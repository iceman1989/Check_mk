Title: Fixed htpasswd permission problem in check_mk standalone installation
Level: 1
Component: core

Class: fix

In a standalone installation the path <tt>/usr/local/nagios/etc</tt> is not writable by the apache user.<br>
The user management module tried to create a file <tt>/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.new</tt> and rename it to
<tt>/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd</tt> afterwards -> failed<br>
The workaround is that no <tt>htpasswd.new</tt> file will be created on standalone installations.
The user management module now directly writes in <tt>htpasswd</tt>.
