description:
 This check monitors the general state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting the
 MBG-SNMP-MIB::mbgLantime ({1.3.6.1.4.1.5597.3.1}) MIB. The check has been
 developed with a GPS170 M3x lantime V5.30k.

 The check handles the reported state of the device, the stratum and the refclock
 state.

 The check raises a {CRITICAL} when the clock is in state {notSynchronized} or
 {noGoodRefclock}. It also handles bad stratums and refclock offsets which can be
 configured. The refclock offset can either be a positive or negative integer.


inventory:
 One check per device is created automatically.

[parameters]
stratum_warn (int): stratums above this value will raise a {WARNING} state.
  The default is set to {0}. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.
stratum_warn (int): stratums above this value will raise a {CRITICAL} state.
  The default is set to {0}. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.
ref_offset_warn (int): refclock offsets above this value will raise a {WARNING} state.
  The default is set to {500} microseconds. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.
ref_offset_crit (int): refclock offsets above this value will raise a {CRITICAL} state.
  The default is set to {1000} microseconds. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.

[configuration]
mbg_lantime_state_default_levels (int, int, int, int): A tuple of four floats or integers: The default
 levels. These levels are used for inventorized checks. This variable
 is preset to {(0, 0, 500, 1000)}
