Title: WATO: Hostlist in folder: enable checkboxes -> all should be checked
Component: wato

When you enable the checkboxes in a WATO folder host list,
then all boxes should initially be checked.

Better solution: readd the bulk buttons also when there
are no checkboxes at all.

Bulk operations now also work without checkboxes
