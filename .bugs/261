There are already a lot of temperature checks. *Each* of them
uses a different scheme for the service description. Make
all checks use "Temperature %s". Also use a common PNP-template
that handles a missing WARN/CRIT. Maybe use a common code base,
if this makes sense.

We also need a tool for renaming service descriptions later on
without loosing history data. That way we have a migration
path - at least for OMD. This includes:

- Events in Nagios log files
- RRDs
- ???

Probleme here is, that the services in question bear the item
in their description - some even have "%s" as description. So
a migration will be tricky.

Further thoughts: We also could live without a migration script
if we simply give the hint in the migration notes of how to
rename the services back to the old scheme:

service_descriptions.update({
    "cisco_temp", "%s",
    ...
}

That way people can decide what to do and new users get
a clean environment.
