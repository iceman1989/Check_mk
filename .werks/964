Title: Fix hanging shutdown of CMC on RedHat 5.X

When using the CMC on RedHat/CentOS 5.X then the CMC would not correctly
shutdown. The reason is, that the Python implementation of that OSes
raises an Exception on sys.exit, while newer versions don't. This has
been fixed by handling <tt>SystemExit</tt> explicitely.
