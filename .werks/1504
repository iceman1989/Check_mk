Title: WATO makes host tag and group information available for NagVis
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1416390031
Class: feature

NagVis can now (till version 1.8rc1) handle Check_MK's host tag and tag group information.
These information can be added to the hover menus of the NagVis objects.

WATO exports the host tag and tag group definitions to a PHP file which is then read by
NagVis to gather the needed information. The PHP file is located at var/check_mk/wato/php-api/hosttags.php
in OMD environments.
