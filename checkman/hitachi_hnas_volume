description:
 Checks the Usage and Status of Volumes in Hitachi HNAS storage systems.

 For usage it uses the check logic of the {df} check, so for configuration
 parameters and examples please refer to the man page of {df}.

 If the status of a volume is reported to be "mounted", the check may
 return {OK}, on status "unformatted" or "formatted", the check returns
 at least {WARN}, on "needsChecking" it returns {CRIT} and {UNKN} on
 every other status.

 The worst status of both (usage levels and status) is returned by the check.

item:
 The ID of a Volume plus it's label, separated by a space, e. g. 1025 data

perfdata:
 Three values: The first value is the used space of the volume
 in MB. Also the minimum (0 MB), maximum (size of the volume) and the
 warning and critical levels in MB are provided.
 The second is the change of the usage in MB per range since the last check
 (e.g. in MB per 24 hours) and the 3rd is the averaged change (so called
 trend), also in MB per range. Please note, that performance data for
 trends is enabled per default. You can globally disable that in {main.mk}
 with {filesystem_default_levels["trend_perfdata"] = False}.

inventory:
 Finds one item per Volume.
