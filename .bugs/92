Title: Make snmp command configurable

This could be like datasource_programs: snmpwalk_programs. It could
enable you to call snmpwalk via SSH and thus close a gap. Or it
could be a very flexible way for using custom SNMP parameters (such
as special port numbers). We need to introduce a few extra place
holders, like <OID> <COMMUNITY> or <AUTH> (which contains -c ....
or SNMPv3 stuff) <SNMPWALK> (which is either snmpwalk or snmpbulkwalk)
<SNMPCMD> (the complete command including all options) and so on...
