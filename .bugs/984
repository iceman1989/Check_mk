Title: Better error message when site cannot be deleted

When you are using D-WATO and want to delete a site, this
is prohibited if folders or hosts are assigned to that site.
If you try, then an error message is printed. But there is
no list of the affected host and folders in question. It
can be very hard to find that in a larger installation
(e.g. some empty folder that has the site in its properties).

Resolution: print out the exakt name of affected hosts an
folders and the error message.
