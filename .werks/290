Title: winperf_processor mem.win: Handling no/empty agent responses correctly now
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7

Class: fix

When a host where these checks were running on was checked, both checks went in
an UNKNOWN state and created an invalid plugin output. Now the check handles this
situation with a nicer error message.
