Title: Livechecks goes zoombie
Component: livecheck

Have been using livecheck and came across this rather nasty bug. We
use livecheck for a whole bunch of http checks (check_http) and after
a while, one of the checks will "hang" and the livecheck process
becomes a "Zombie" process.

Nagios completely stops doing anything, when you kill the check_http
process, Nagios comes back to life:
