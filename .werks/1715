Title: Output icon information in CSV/JSON/Python export of views
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1418057797
Class: feature

When exporting views to JSON, Python or CSV the column with the icons
is now no longer empty but is a space separated list of all icon names
of the host/sevice in question - without path information or the suffixes
of the file type. That way you now can get additional information about
the objects.
