Class: feature

It is now possible to manage hosts via web requests.  This includes the following operations:

<ul>
<li>Add host</li>
<li>Edit host</li>
<li>Delete host</li>
<li>Get host attributes</li>
<li>Host service discovery</li>
<li>Activate changes</li>
</ul>

These operations also work in a distributed environment. You can find more
information regarding these web request in the <tt>Roles & Permissions</tt>
page under a roles settings.  There is a new permission topic <tt>Web API</tt>
where you can configure the permissions of all available API requests. The
help texts for these permissions provide some useful examples.

In the near future, there will be a "Howto Web-API" article in our online
documentation, too.
