Title: Hooks users-saved called duplicate when doing WATO sync
Component: wato
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2013-10-08 18:24:47
Targetversion: 1.2.3i3

When doing a replicated WATO sync, then the hook users-saved is
being called twice. We should elimiate that. Especially because
there might be involved lengthy LDAP syncs
