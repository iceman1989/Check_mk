title: CPU utilization via SNMP HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
agents: snmp
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB} is a standardized MIB provided by many
 SNMP agents. This check uses that MIB in order to monitor the
 current CPU utilization of the target host. Please note, that - unlike
 check based on the check_mk_agent, the percentage does not reflect
 the usage during the complete check interval but is just a snapshot
 of the current usage.

perfdata:
 One variable: the current CPU percentage (0..100)

inventory:
 One check is automatically created if at least one CPU
 entry is found in the SNMP output.

[parameters]
warning (int): CPU utilization percentage at which a warning level ist triggered.

critical (int): CPU utilization percentage at which a critical level ist triggered.

[configuration]
hr_cpu_default_levels (int, int): Default levels used by inventorized checks. This variable is preset to {(80, 90)}.
