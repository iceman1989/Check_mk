Title: Handle ctrl-c for inventory
Component: core
Class: nastiness
State: done

Targetversion: 1.2.2

Currently, trying to abort an inventory only kills the current inventory. If you
have simply specified cmk -I you'll need to abort as many times as there are hosts
It would be nice to be able to press ctrl-c once and have that handled by
cmk so that it aborts the whole process, ideally in a consistent state.

Currently we have the problem, that the snmp commands get the Ctrl-C and not
Python. Can we start the snmp commands without a controlling terminal? 
And the gracefully handle Ctrl-C in Check_MK.

This could simply be solved by adding a SIGINT handler to check_mk
