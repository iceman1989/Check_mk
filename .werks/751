The new local check is in <tt>share/doc/check_mk/treasures/localchecks/check_fstab_mounts</tt>. Simply
copy it to <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local/</tt> on your Linux agents. It will alert you if any
filesystem that is listed in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> is not being mounted. Filesystems with the option
<tt>noauto</tt> are excluded from the check.
