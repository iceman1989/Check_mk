title: System Event Log from SMBIOS/DMI
agents: linux

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check reads the entries of the SEL (System Event Log) from
 SMBIOS/DMI on FSC Celsius m470 systems (and maybe others).

 The check has been developed to detect ECC single- and multibit
 memory errors on FSC Celsius systems.

 This check uses the information of the userspace utility
 {fsc-celsius-m470-sel} which reads the current contents of the SEL
 directly from /dev/mem. To work properly the {dmidecode} and
 {fsc-celsius-m470-sel} binaries need to be installed on the
 system and must be available in the PATH.

 Please note that the fsc-celsius-m470-sel is still experimental and
 has not been tested on other systems.

 You need to extend your agent on the monitored system
 using a check_mk_agent plugin named {fsc-celsius-m470-sel.sh}. This
 agent plugin can be found in the {fsc-celsius-m470-sel-1.1.tar.gz}
 archive in the {doc} directory of check_mk.

 To enable this plugin simply copy it to the plugins directory of
 check_mk_agent on your target machines. By default the directory
 is located here: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins.

 This plugin has been developed on FSC Celsius m470 but may also work
 on other FSC hardware platforms. Please tell us when you find some
 other software where this plugin outputs valid information.

 The Nagios service will show the worst state which can be found in the
 SEL. Each known SEL record has a status level which is hardcoded in the
 check_mk check.

inventory:
 One service named {SEL} will be created on all valid systems.
