At the moment bi aggregations are added as local checks to make nagios services
out of them to be able to create notifications for them.

It would be nice to make those aggregations configurable via WATO. This could
be a ruleset which makes all or specific BI aggregations virtual hosts or services.

This could maybe done using piggyback.

As a result it would be nice to give users the option to which hosts these services
shal be added. For example a single host aggregation should be added directly to the
host and a multi host aggregation be added to a virtual host or a cluster host.
