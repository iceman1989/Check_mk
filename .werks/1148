The Event Console now allows to attach actions to the cancelling of
events. This can for example be helpful if you have an action that opens a
trouble ticket in an external system. When a cancelling event arrives you
can have executed an action that also cancels the according trouble ticket.

When events are cancelled then several data fields of the event are being
replaced with data from the new event before the action is being executed. That
way relevant data from the new event is available in the action script. Also
the event phase is being set to <tt>closed</tt> and the state is set to
0 (OK).  That way your action script can distinguish between a normal
and a cancelling situation.

The following fields are taken from the new (i.e. cancelling) event:

<ul>
<li>The text</li>
<li>The time</li>
<li>The time of the last occurance</li>
<li>The syslog priority</li>
</ul>

All other fields are unchanged - including the original ID of the cancelled
event.
