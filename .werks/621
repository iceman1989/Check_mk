Title: zfsget: better filesystem selection and calculation of sizes
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i4

Class: fix

zfsget now only inventorizes filesystems of type "filesystem".

If a mountpoint is present several times in the zfsget section of the agent
data (with different device name), and also in the df section, the entry
in the zfsget section with the device name from the df section is taken for
calculating the data.
