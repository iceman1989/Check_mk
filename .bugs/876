Title: Notification form broken after personal settings editing

Targetversion: 1.2.2

When editing the personal settings while being permitted to edit the custom notifications,
the shown data seems to be broken after submission. For example the title of a custom
notification is set to "Notify by: (no title)" instead of the correct title.

It seems that the CascadingDropdown (and maybe also ListOf) do not use the "value" provided
to the render_input() method. Instead of it they try to fetch the infos from html.var.

fixed.
