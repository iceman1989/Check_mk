Title: Allow overriding of active and custom checks by more specific rule

If you define an active or custom Check via WATO in the main folder and
then want to override this check in a subfolder, that was not possible up
to now. Now if you define an active check <b>with the same type and service
description</b> by a more specific rule, then that rule will override the
more general ones (i.e. those coming later).
