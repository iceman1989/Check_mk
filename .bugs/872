Title: Speedometer scheduler is not terminated when removed from sidebar
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: future

When having e.g. the speedometer in the sidebar and removing it, the javascript worker code
remains fetching the speedometer webservice. The worker should detect that the snapin has
been removed and stop updating the data.

Not a general problem: The speedometer uses its own scheduler. Must be fixed individually.

The speedometer timeout detects the removal of the snpain and terminates itselfs now.
