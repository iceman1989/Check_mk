Title: cisco_vpn_tunnel: Refactored complete check, fixed threshold bugs
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417714529
Class: fix

Improved check in different ways:

- When configuring OK as failed tunnel state, this was not handled correctly by the check. 
- Clarified the valuespec titles and help texts.
- Check did not process multiple VPN tunnel configurations defined in a single rule.
- Cleaned up check code

Sadly had no data for testing here... Let's hope for the best.
