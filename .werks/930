Title: WATO snapshots: disabled upload of legacy snaphots and snapshots with invalid checksums
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1401449745
Class: security

The upload of insecure snapshots has been disabled per default, because those
snapshots represent a security risk if their content were modified willingly or unwillingly.
Insecure snapshots are all legacy snapshots and snapshots of the newer type, but with an invalid checksum.

You can re-enable the upload of insecure snapshots via the new global setting<br>
<tt>Configuration GUI (WATO) -> Allow upload of insecure WATO snapshots</tt>
