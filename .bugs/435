In order to make capacity planning of Livestatus possible
we need to monitor the number of currently active Livestatus
client threads. We can add this as a number for the status
table. Each client thread simply adds 1 to a global variable
during its active phase (secured by a semaphore or critical
region). We also could provide statistics about the usage
and sizes of the OutputBuffers.
