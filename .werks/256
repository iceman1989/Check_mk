Title: wato snapshots: snapshot restore no longer fails with older python versions
Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389714765

Python versions <= 2.6.6 had problems on restoring snapshots files.<br>
The python tarfile module crashed when it tried to unpack tarfiles with no content.<br>
The new implementation now uses the tar from the command line instead of the python tarfile module.
