Title: table servicegroups: fixed service visibility when using group_authorization AUTH_STRICT
Level: 1
Component: livestatus

Class: fix

This only applies with the setting group_authorization = AUTH_STRICT

When an auth user was given the livestatus table servicegroups did not check if the auth
user had permissions to all objects of the servicegroup.
As a result the user was able to view servicegroups, even if he was not a contact for every object in it.
However, the "forbidden" object itself was not returned, just a subset of the group.
This was incorrect. The user needs to be contact of every element in this group.
Otherwise he should not see the group at all..
