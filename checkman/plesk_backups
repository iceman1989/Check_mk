title: FTP backups of Plesk domains
agents: linux
catalog: app/Plesk
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Plesk is a commercial webhosting management software. It allows you to
 manage multiple independent webspace instances including domains and
 so on.

 This check checks the FTP backups and backup space of Plesk domains.

 To make this check work you need to install the agent plugin
 {plesk_backups} on the host wich runs Plesk in the
 directory {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}.

item:
  The domain name of the domain backuped.

examples:
 # set up a check for a plesk backup
 # warn if backup is older than 1 day (86400 sec)
 # and crit if older than 2 days
 # warn if Maximum size of all files on backup space is > 70 MB
 # (73400320 Bytes) and crit if > 80 MB
 # warn also if no backup is configured or no backup can be found
 static_checks['plesk_backups'] = [
    ( ('plesk_backups',
       'Backup example.com',
       { 'backup_age': (86400, 172800),
         'total_size': (73400320, 83886080),
         'no_backup_configured_state': 1,
         'no_backup_found_state': 1
       }),
       [], ['localhost1']
    ),
 ]

perfdata:
  Three values:
    last backup size in bytes,
    last backup age in seconds and
    total size of all backups in bytes

inventory:
 One check per plesk domain is created if the {plesk_backups} agent plugin
 is installed and working (it outputs the {<<<plesk_backups>>>} section).

[parameters]
backup_age(int, int): if the age of the backup (in seconds) is older than the first value, return {WARN} state, if older than the second one, return {CRIT} state
total_size(int, int): if the total size of all backups on the backup space (in bytes) is larger than than the first value, return {WARN} state, if larger than the second one, return {CRIT} state
no_backup_configured_state(int): the numeric state that should be returned if no backup is configured ( 0 = {OK}, 1 = {WARN}, 2 = {CRIT} )
no_backup_found_state(int): the numeric state that should be returned if no backup can be found ( 0 = {OK}, 1 = {WARN}, 2 = {CRIT} )
