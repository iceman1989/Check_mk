Title: if: allow to configure link speed statically
Component: checks

In some cases the link speed of an interface is either detected wrong
or the actually usable maximum is other then the nominal speed.

In that cases it would be helpful to be able to configure that
actual link speed statically in the check parameters (and also
disable speed checking by this).

This could be done by a new paramter "assumed_speed" = 10000000.
