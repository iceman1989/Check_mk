Title: Fixed exception in Web GUI "Internal error:: name 'Filter' is not defined" in manual setups (using setup.py)
Level: 1

Previous versions shipped the file web/plugins/views/filters.py. This file is deprecated now, but manual
setups of Check_MK (the ones using setup.py to install Check_MK) have the file left after an update. To
workaround this issue, we ship an empty dummy file now to replace the original one.

If you like to fix this problem manually without applying this update, just remove the file
web/plugins/views/filters.py from your installation.
