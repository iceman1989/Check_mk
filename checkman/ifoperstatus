description:
 This check polls the SNMP OID .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 (IF-MIB::ifOperStatus)
 which is part of the standard SNMP interfaces MIB. It checks network interfaces
 for their operational status (the link). The link can either be 'up' or 'down'.
 The check status is OK if the actual link status is equal to the target status.
 If the target status is 'up' and the link status is 'down', the check gets
 CRITICAL. If the link status is 'up' and the target status is 'down', the check
 gets into WARNING status.

item:
 A string: the name of the interface as in .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 (IF-MIB::ifDescr). The
 OID index is not relevant.

inventory:
 checks for all interfaces found up and of the correct types (default is {ethernetCsmacd})
 are created.

[parameters]
targetstatus (string): The target status of the interface, for example {"up"} or {"down"}. This
 can also be given as list of string to set multiple expected states.
 There are other possible values for the target status: {"unknown"}, {"dormant"},
 {"notPresent"} or {"lowerLayerDown"}.

[configuration]
ifoperstatus_monitor_unused (boolean): Determines weather unused ports should
 be monitored. This has an influence only on inventory. If set to True,
 it will created checks with target status 'down' for unused ports. The default
 value is False.
ifoperstatus_inventory_porttypes (list of strings): list of port types to be found
 be inventory. Default is {[ "ethernetCsmacd" ]}.
