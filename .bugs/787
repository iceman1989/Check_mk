Title: Perfdata varname of df should be fixed to 'size'
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.3i1
Class: cleanup

Currently the fs check uses the name of the mount point as the variable name
for the filesystem performance data.  In the case of Windows mount points
there is a backslash included which makes everything problematic.

There is just one drawback: People with multiple RRDs will loose their
filesystem history once again... :-( For some time we could offer an option
that switches to the old format.
