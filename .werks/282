Title: TIMEPERIOD TRANSITION messages no longer cut at 64 bytes

Whenever the timeperiod name was specified very long not all information got
logged into the monitoring history during a timeperiod transition.<br>
For example:<br>
nagios-02-07-2014-00.log:[1391684695] TIMEPERIOD TRANSITION: ab@mathias-kettner.de_demo_timeperiod@shd-online.d<br><br>

Some mandatory information was missing at the end of the line, thus causing
the livestatus statehist table to crash, while processing such an invalid entry.
