Class: feature
Compatible: incomp

Cause of a wrong naming in the APC MIB, the value AdvBatteryTemperature shows not the Battery Temperature but the System Temperature.
Cause of the renaming also the name of the Performance value changed from battemp to systemp. If you don't want to loose that graph, you have to migrate
the file to ne new name.
