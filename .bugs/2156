Title: Do always create contact groups, even if no host/service is contained
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-05-26 14:18:35
Targetversion: future

The rule based notifications allow the selection of a contact group as
a rule's contact selection. If you create contact groups with WATO that do
not contain any host or service then these groups will not be created with
the Nagios core - and thus the notification will not be sent out. The
Micro Core is not affected as it seems.

Beware: an unpatched Nagios might not consider this as a valid configuration.
If that is the case then we need a global config option. We then set this
option to True for OMD installations and patch Nagios in OMD.

Contact groups with contacts assigned, but without host/services are now created
within Nagios (they are already available within CMC).
