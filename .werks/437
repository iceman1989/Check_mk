Title: Convert WATO rule for debug_log into simple Checkbox
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: feature

Do you know the plugin output <i>invalid output from agent, invalid check
parameters or ...</i>?  The option for debugging such failed checks has
been converted from an absolute path to a simple Checkbox. The target path
for the log file is now hardcoded and will be printed by the failed check
in the plugin output. The advantage is that when using OMD the option
will work on all sites of a distributed environment and will log to
<tt>var/log/check_mk/crashed-checks.log</tt> within the site.

Existing configurations will not be touched, though, and honor the configured
path - as long as you do not change the option via WATO. <tt>main.mk</tt> still
allows the old way:

F+:main.mk
# Hard code path to log file
debug_log = "/var/log/foo.log"

# Simply enable and use standard path
debug_log = True

# Disable
debug_log = None

# New way to disable
debug_log = False
