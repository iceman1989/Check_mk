Title: logwatch.ec: Optionally monitor the list of forwarded logfiles
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1392629160
Class: feature

You can now have the check <tt>logwatch.ec</tt> - Event Console forwarding of
logfiles - monitor the list of forwarded logfiles. This is enabled by setting
<tt>"monitoring_logfilelist"</tt> to <tt>True</tt> in the checks parameter
dictionary. WATO shows this as a new check box <i>Warn if list of forwarded
logfiles changes</i> in the rule set <i>Logwatch Event Console Forwarding</i>.

During inventory the check remembers the list of currently present logfiles
that should be forwarded to the Event Console. If that list changes at any
time later then the check goes to WARN and displays the missing/exceeding
logfiles. Re-inventorize the check in order to acknowledge the new list.
