Title: WATO snapshots: improved validation of (uploaded) snapshots
Level: 1
Component: wato
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1392892008

Some new validation features have been added<br>

<ul>
<li>Only tar and tar.gz files can be uploaded</li>
<li>It is checked if the file size if reasonable</li>
<li>It is checked if the content of the tarfile 'looks' OK (real check is done later)</li>
</ul>

Upon restoring the snapshot, an additional integrity check is done for
each of the subtar files. If this check fails, e.g. some tar.gz is corrupted,
the snapshot won't get applied and an error message is raised.
