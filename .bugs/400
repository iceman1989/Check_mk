Title: Service Hardstate-Filter conflicts with Hoststate filter
Component: multisite
Date: 2011-10-27 15:00:16
State: done
Class: bug
Fun: 0
Targetversion: 1.1.12

The service hard state filter uses the HTML variables hst0, hst1, ...
just like the host state filter. Change this to hdst0, hdst1, ....
Otherwise the filter will also have the same setting as the
host state filter.

This might affect builtin views. Check them...

The variables for the hard state filters are now
prefixed with hd instead of h.
