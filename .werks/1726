Title: Move variable data of Linux/UNIX agents to /var/lib/check_mk_agent
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: feature

The Linux, AIX, Solaris and other UNIX agents now put state and cache files
no longer below <tt>/etc/check_mk</tt> but per default below <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent</tt>.
This can be changed directly in the agent in the following line:

F+:check_mk_agent.*
export MK_VARDIR=/var/lib/check_mk_agent
F-:

This means that if you update to the new version of the agent, you must have
in mind the following things:

<ul>
<li>Check_MK agent will not find saved <tt>logwatch.state</tt> files and will consider all logfiles as new. This means
that you will miss up to one check cycle of possible new logfile entries.</li>
<li>Check_MK agent will forget its cached data and recompute all asynchronous checks</li>
<li>Maybe other plugin-specific loss of memory</li>
</ul>

You can prevent this by manually copying selective data from
<tt>/etc/check_mk</tt>, if you like.
