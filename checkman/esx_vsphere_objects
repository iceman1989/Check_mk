title: VMWare ESX: Location and state of VMs and host systems
agents: vsphere
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check makes sure that items sent by the ESX special agent (hostsystems
 and VMs) are stil present later on. The information about this data can also
 be used for determining the architecture of a VMWare farm out of the monitoring
 data.

 The check will get warning if a host or VM is powered off or suspended. But
 this can be configured via a check parameter.

inventory:
 One service per hostsystem and per VM will be created, regardless of its state.

item:
 The text {HostSystem} or {VM} followed by a space followed by the name of the host system
 or VM.

examples:
 # Allow VMs beginning with "testvm" to be powered off.
 check_parameters = [
   ( { "states" : { "poweredOff" : 0 } }, [ "esx-host01" ], [ "VM testvm" ]),
 ]


[parameters]
params(dict): A dictionary will currently one optional key: {states}. This is again a dictionary
 with the optional entries {"poweredOn"}, {"poweredOff"} and {"suspended"}. The value for each
 entry is {0}, {1}, {2} or {3} and sets the check result in that case to OK, WARN, CRIT or UNKNOWN.
