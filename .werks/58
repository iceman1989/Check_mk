On some systems the locale C.UTF-8 was not always available. One of these is
Debien Squeeze. Sending a notification email containing non-ASCII characters
like german Umlauts failed in these situations.

This now has been fixed by scanning all available encodings (output of locale
-a) and selecting an existing UTF-8 encoding. Please make sure that at least
one such encoding exists.

This fix also makes sure that the output of a failed mail submission is
being logged in the notification log (if you have enabled it).
