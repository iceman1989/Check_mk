Title: WATO-Path context gets lost when clicking view in snapin

When one has a WATO path context (by clicking on the Hosts-Snapin with
the WATO tree) and then clicks on a new view in the Views-Snapin, then
that context gets lost. I think it would be better if that context
would be preserved.

We think that the current behavior is the best solution 
for now..
