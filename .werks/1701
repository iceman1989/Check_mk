Title: Correctly show absolute level for CPU load in case of warn/crit
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417771579
Class: fix

In the check parameters of the CPU load check the levels are given in
load <i>per Core</i>. The check plugin output displayed this as level, but
this was confusing. Now the absolute level is being displayed instead.
