Many people have servers with service boards. The servers are monitored
with TCP and maybe also SNMP. The service boards have different IP
addresses and are monitored via SNMP. It would be *very* nice to have that
services mapped onto the actual server, not onto a separate host in 
the monitoring.

Find a good, simple solution with a simple and clear code impact.
