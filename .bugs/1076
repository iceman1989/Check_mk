Title: $COUNT$ empty in non-counting rule
Component: ec

Targetversion: 1.4.0

If you use the placeholder $COUNT$ in actions or emails and have no counting
rule, then the macro is not being replaced. Would should make a better macro
replacement, that is not based on the actual fields of an event but on the
declared fields, and apply default values for any missing field.
