title: Ressource consumption of windows processes
agents: windows
catalog: os/ps
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Note: This check is obsolete. Do not install {wmicchecks.bat} anymore. Use
 {psperf.bat} in combination with the normal {ps.perf} check. The rest of
 this man page is unchanged for legacy reasons:

 This check uses the output of {wmic process} in order to monitor the ressource
 consumption of processes on Windows servers. On the target host this check
 needs the command line utility {wmic} and the agent plugin {wmicchecks.bat}
 (in the subdirectory {plugins} below the directory where {check_mk_agent.exe}
 is located).

 The monitored parameters are CPU usage ({KernelModeTime} + {UserModeTime}),
 RAM usage ({WorkingSetSize}) and page file usage ({PageFileUsage}).
 If more than one process matches the name, then all matching processes ressources
 are added.

 If no matching process is found running, then the check is always OK (since
 no ressources are consumed).

item:
 A user definable string that is used as part of the service description.
 If you choose {"APACHE"} as item, for example, then the check will be
 named {proc_APACHE}.

perfdata:
 Four value are sent: (1) The memory usage in MB, (2) The page file usage in MB,
 (3) The CPU usage in user mode in %, (4) The CPU usage in kernel mode in %.

examples:
 # Monitor ressources used by SSHD processes.
 # Warn at 20MB RAM or 10MB page file or 80% CPU usage
 # Critical at 30MB RAM or 15MB page file or 90% CPU usage
 checks += [
  ( "klapp", "wmic_process", "SSHD", ( "sshd.exe", 20, 30, 10, 15, 80, 90)),
 ]

[parameters]
name (string): The name of the process including {.exe}

memwarn, memcrit (int, int): The levels in MB for memory usage

pagewarn, pagecrit (int, int): The level in MB for page file usage

cpuwarn, cpucrit (int, int): The level in % for CPU usage (kernel plus user)
