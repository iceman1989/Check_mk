title: State of Microsoft Active Directory Replication between DCs
agents: windows
catalog: os/Active Directory
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check analyzes the replication status of Microsoft Active Directory Domain
 Controllers. Each replication partner of a Domain Controller results in one
 separate service.

 The number of replication failures and the times of the last successful/failed
 replications are checked. The check raises a CRITICAL state when the maximum failed
 threshold is reached and when the last failed replication is newer than the last
 successful replication.

 The windows agent needs to be extended with the {ad_replication.bat} provided
 in {agents/windows/plugins}.

inventory:
 Each replication partner results in one service.

item:
 The name of the replication partner.

[parameters]
max_failed (int): The maximum number of failures to be tolerated. All counts above
 will raise a CRITICAL state

[configuration]
ad_replication_default_params (tuple of ints): Default value is set to 15/20 (warn/crit) {(15,20)}.
