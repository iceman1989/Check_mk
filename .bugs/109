Title: Restart of Nagios makes Nagios inherit TCP port

If you restart Nagios via WATO, then Apache restarts Nagios
und the new Nagios process inherits the open files of Apache.
That way Nagios inherits also the listening Port 5000. This
makes it impossible to restart apache later.

Solution unclear. Either user reload instead of restart or
try to explicitely close all filedescriptors after forking.
But how can we do that?

Fixed in modules/check_mk.py. We close all filedescriptors from 3..256 before 
restarting Nagios.
