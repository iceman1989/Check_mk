Title: cisco_temp_sensor: Value reported of check was not always correct (precision was wrong)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

We already had a workaround to get the correct precision of the value reported by the device,
but this code was kind of a hack. No we retrieve the precision value from the target device
and then scale the value according to it.
