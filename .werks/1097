Title: windows_agent: preventing missing agent sections on first query
Level: 2

Class: fix

The windows agent did not report all sections on the first request(s) after
its startup, if some plugins were configured to run asynchronous.

This has been fixed. During startup, the agent now always executes the ASYNC scripts first
and waits for them to finish. After the scripts are finished, it starts listening to
the tcp port.
