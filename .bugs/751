Title: CascadingDropdown: visibility broken in case of complain
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-16 05:43:37
Targetversion: 1.2.0

If the validate_value raises an exception, the sub-vs will
not be visible. Try this out: got the the details of one
multisite connection, select "Connect via TCP", leave the
host field empty and save.

This should be solved now. Hope I understood that magic thing ;-).
Need to review my changes with Mathias.
