Title: New button in service list for refreshing all services

In the list of a hosts's services there is now always a new button <i>Automatic
Refresh (Tabula Rasa)</i>. This button does the same as the bulk inventory
with the Tabula Rasa option, but just for that single host: It removes all
autochecks and reinventorizes the host. This is a conveniant way to reset
network interface checks to OK after some ports have changed from down to
up or vice versa.  Also changes in the mount options of Linux filesystems
can thus be acknowledged.
