title: Length of MS Exchange queues
agents: windows
catalog: app/exchange
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the current length of various MS Exchange
 mail queues. You need a Windows agent of version {1.1.11i1} or
 later and have the counter object {msx_queues} activated.
 This counter is activated per default with the number {10332}.

 If the counter number is different in your installation or
 you are using a {check_mk.ini} with custom counter definitions,
 add the counter to the section {[winperf]} with {counters = 10332:msx_queues} ... .
 Look in the output of {lodctr /s:counters.ini} for the object with
 the name {MSExchangeTransport Queues}.

 You can set levels for warning and critical. Per default
 the queues {Active Remote Delivery}, {Active Mailbox Delivery},
 {Retry Remote Delivery} and {Poison} are monitored.

item:
 The name of the queue as defined in {winperf_msx_queues}.

examples:
 # Define queues to be monitored
 winperf_msx_queues = {
        "Active Remote Delivery"          : "10334",
        "Retry Remote Delivery"           : "10336",
        "Active Mailbox Delivery"         : "10338",
        "Retry Non-Smtp Delivery"         : "10344",
        "Items Queued For Delivery Total" : "10350",
 }

 # Default levels for all queues
 msx_queues_default_levels = (100, 200)

perfdata:
 One value: the current length of the queue in question.

inventory:
 For each queue that is defined in {winperf_msx_queues} one check
 will be created if the agent outputs the matching performance counters.

[parameters]
warn(int): Warning level for number of mails in queue
crit(int): Critical level

[configuration]
msx_queues_default_levels(int, int): Default warning and critical levels for
 inventorized checks

winperf_msx_queues(dict): A dictionary defining the mail queues to be
  inventorized. The keys of this dictionary are names of the queues to be
  used in the service descriptions. These names are freely definable and need
  not to be identical to the "official" names.  The values
  are the numbers (as string) of the according performance counters. If you
  are in search of those numbers, open a command box on your Windows host,
  call {lodctr /s:counters.ini} and than copy the file {counters.ini} to
  Linux. There convert it with {recode UTF-16LE..UTF-8 counters.ini}. Now
  you can view it e.g. with {less} and look for the counter numbers.
