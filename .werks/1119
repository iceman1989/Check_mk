Title: WATO create rule: No longer raises an incorrect permission warning when creating a new rule
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6

Class: fix

A normal monitoring user which had only permissions to a given subfolder
could not create a new rule when the rule formular was created with the
main directory as rule path.<br><br>

For example, if the user pressed "Create in folder: 'Main directory'" and
switched the actual rule folder to his subfolder afterwards.<br>
This resulted in a permission warning stating that the user has no permission to
write into the 'Main directory'.
