Title: Fixed corruption in SNMP walks created with cmk --snmpwalk
Level: 1

Class: fix

In some situations SNMP walks created with <tt>cmk --snmpwalk</tt> were
broken and caused an exception when trying to use them. This has been
fixed.

In stored snmpwalks up to now binary values were stored in their binary
representation which caused problems when reading them. Now they are stored
in their ASCII representation.

Furthermore for producing stored walks the inline SNMP is never used.
Stored walks are always created by the command line tools, no regard what
the Global Setting is set to.
