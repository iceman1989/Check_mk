The states of events created by a rule can now be set by regex patterns. A rule can now
create events with different states. The mechanism is as follows:

1. The "text to match" patterns needs to match a message
2. When a rule has configured "(set by message text)" as state, and patterns are defined
for the single states, the message will be matches agains these patterns to calculate
the state of the event.
3. When none of these patterns matches, the event is set to UNKNOWN
