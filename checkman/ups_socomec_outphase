description:
 Monitors voltage, current and load output phases of Socomec UPSs. Current is purely informative
 as of now and does not support setting parameters.

item:
 The identifier of the phase (usually {"1"}, {"2"}, {"3"}).

perfdata:
 Three values: Voltage, current, load.

inventory:
 One check per Socomec UPS output phase is created.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check supports two types of parameters. It is a dictionary with the following keys:

 {"voltage"}: Warning and critical levels for voltage in int, denoting the minimum required voltage in volt. Default values are (210, 200).

 {"load"}: Warning and critical levels for load in int, denoting load in percent. Default values are (80, 90).
