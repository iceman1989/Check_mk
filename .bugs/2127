Title: EC-Check: Make check for hostname AND ipaddress match possible
Component: ec

When e.g. receiving SNMP-traps, only the ipaddress is known in the event. The view resolves the ipaddress to existing
hostnames. As a result, the user thinks the "check event state in event console" check can check for events with matching
host name. But this is not true, since the event only has the ipaddress stored.

Either add an option "hostname or ipaddress" to the ec-check or use livestatus to try to resolve ipaddres to hostnames
to make this easier to handle.
