Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1

Class: feature

If you leave user name and password empty, the special agent tries to
authenticate against the EMC VNX device by Security Files.
These need to be created manually before using. Therefor run as
instance user (if using OMD) or Nagios user (if not using OMD)
a command like
<tt>naviseccli -AddUserSecurity -scope 0 -password PASSWORD -user USER</tt>
This creates <tt>SecuredCLISecurityFile.xml</tt> and
<tt>SecuredCLIXMLEncrypted.key</tt> in the home directory of the user
and these files are used then.
