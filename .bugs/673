Title: Service details view should not show Filter tab
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness
State: closed
Date: 2012-04-08 11:01:32
Targetversion: 1.2.0

No filter is being shown, but the filter tab is there
and a search button.

The reason is probably that one filter is there (the
WATO path filter?) but is not being displayed?
