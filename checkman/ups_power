description:
 This checks just monitors the output power (in Watt) of the
 output phases of a UPS that supports the generic UPS-MIB
 (such as General Electric (GE) SitePro UPS).
 You can define warning and critical levels of power, below which
 the phases must not drop. Each phase is realized as a separate
 check.

examples:
 # Trigger warning/critical level if power drops below 100 or 20 Watt
 ups_power_default_levels = (100, 20)

perfdata:
 The current output power int Watt

inventory:
 Supported.

[parameters]
warn (int): The warning level: the power should not drop at or below this level
crit (int): The critical level: the power must not drop at or below this level

[configuration]
ups_power_default_levels (int, int): The default levels to be used
   for inventorized checks. This variable is preset to {(20, 1)}
