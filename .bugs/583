Title: parenting configuration from WATO (folders/tags)
Component: wato
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: feature

Currently you can't edit the parents from within WATO.
There's multiple ways to get this, usually you'd just need a location tag
for systems in a certain location,
on the other hand we could think about doing this on the folder level as
a WATO-super-feature (most people seem to have "geo-folders" anyway)
