Title: windows_agent: processing of eventlog messages is time consuming
Component: checks
State: open

Class: nastiness

To resolve the text from an eventlog entry the windows agent opens
the corresponding dll file and reads the text for the given event id.
It seems that for each line the dll is opened again by LoadLibrary()
