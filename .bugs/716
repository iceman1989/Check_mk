Title: Timeperiods as exceptions can only be selected after saving the rule
Component: wato
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2012-08-01 11:17:46
Targetversion: 1.2.0

This is a nasty interface problem (for the user)
If you add a timeperiod, the exception (text) field is visible,
but the dropdown for selecting a timeperiod exception is not.
If you save the rule and go back to edit mode, then the dropdown
is there.

This works with current WATO.
