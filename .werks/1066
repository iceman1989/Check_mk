Title: New Dashboard Designer
Level: 3
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1406631300
Class: feature

This change implements the long awaited Dashboard Designer. With this feature users
can edit existing dashboards, create new ones and provide their dashboards to other
users just like it can be done with the views.

Another nice feature is the formalized context we introduced for views and dashboards.
With this concept it is possible to create a host specific dashboard once and open
it for several different hosts. You can create a "Oracle Database dashboard" once
which can show you the state of a single database server. The name of the database
server (context: hostname) of your choice can be provided when accessing the dashboard
to "instanciate" such a dashboard.

Dashboards edited by users are saved in <tt>var/check_mk/web/USER/user_dashboards.mk</tt>
just like edited views are now saved in <tt>var/check_mk/web/USER/user_views.mk</tt>. The
views saved by a user before this release which are stored in <tt>var/check_mk/web/USER/views.mk</tt>
will be migrated automatically once the user edits it's first view. From this time the
new edited views will be read/written from/to the new file.

For details take a look at the <a href="/checkmk_multisite_dashboards.html">dashboard documentation</a>.
