Title: Filter settings containing checkboxes get unset when issuing commands
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-24 19:55:24
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Open a view, open the filter, deselect "OK" state, save -> you
get less services. No click on commands and issue the command.
The filter will be ignored.

Reason: the filled_in HTML variable, that is used by get_checkbox()
is now not longer "filter", but "commands".

2012-05-24 20:13:52: changed state open -> done
This now works. Hope that my fix didn't break anything else.
Watch of for dialogs with checkboxes....
