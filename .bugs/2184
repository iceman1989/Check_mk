Title: SNMP Community in host properties not shown on IE?
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: future

A host that is tagged as SNMP host is opened in WATO. Nevertheless
the attribute SNMP Community is not visible. In Firefox it is
visible. Looks like some JS problem with IE...

Switching back and forth the tag seems not help.

Fixed.
