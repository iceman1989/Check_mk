Title: setup.sh does not setup permissions for WATO correctly

The setup.sh should try to setup permissions for WATO. We might
need a SGID bit and 775 permissions for the Webserver.
Also check if OMD share mode is working correctly.

I've fixed several directory permissions and hope
that it's mostly working now.
