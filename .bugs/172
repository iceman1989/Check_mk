This is unbelievable. But on Windows popen() on a .txt
files really starts notepad.exe - even if the agent
is running as service. That process appears in the process
list and hangs forever - without using CPU or opening
a window. The agent waits until eternity for its termination.

Solution is not quite clear. Maybe keep a fixed list
of supported extensions (.cmd, .com, .exe, .vbs).
