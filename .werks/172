Title: zfsget: Check is now usable in cluster_mode
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1404216186
Class: feature

Until now, it was not possible to move zfs filesystems to a check_mk defined cluster host. This is now possible. It was nescessary to rewrite
the hole check logic, so it's possible that we introduced new bugs, so please double-check the output of the plugin.
