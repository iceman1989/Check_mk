Title: zfsget: fixed compatibility with older Solaris agents
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1396620030

The check zfsget expected more fields in the section zfsget than
that the check_mk_agent.solaris delivered - the fstype was missing
This caused an exception in the zfsget check.

The problem has been fixed in the check itself, so it can handle
both agent output versions. Now its also fixed in the agent output.
