Title: Create default rules
Component: ec
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.2
Class: feature

Create a set of default rules, at least one rule which should remain as 
"last rule" which  simply drops all messages not handled by the rules
above. When having a rule, it is possible to count the times this rule
was used to maybe define better "catch & drop" rules at the beginning
of the ruleset

Solution: We create one rule with count(1) that create *one* open
counting event per host. This rule is created if the file rules.mk
does not exist when entering the event editor. This can simply be
done in WATO: EC load_rules.
