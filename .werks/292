Title: Inline SNMP: Check_MK check helpers are closing UDP sockets now
Level: 1
Component: core
Version: 1.2.3i7

Class: fix

In previous versions, the Check-Helpers in Check_MK were opening UDP
sockets for each host and caching them during their runtime. This resulted
in too many open sockets with a large amount of hosts. Now closing all
the sockets after an action iteration.
