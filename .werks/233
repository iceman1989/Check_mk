Title: Fixed missing entries in log file and availability view
Level: 2
Component: livestatus
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384968812
Class: fix

This problem occurred for example when you first visited the
global logfile and afterwards used the availability reporting.

This problem was due a bug in livestatus that affected the tables <tt>log</tt>
and <tt>statehist</tt>.  Two consecutive logfile queries, each with different
logclasses, could lead to invalid/missing logfile entries.
