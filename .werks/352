Title: Avoid Livestatus connections on pages that do not need them

In many pages in Multisite and especially WATO Livestatus connections
are not neccessary. In previous versions the connection was built
up anyway. Now this is done only when needed. That cuts down the total
rate of Livestatus connections and also speeds up installations with
many sites.
