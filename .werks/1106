Class: feature

The mk_inventory.ps1 needs to create statefile for each host.
The path of this files were hardcoded to <tt>c:\Program Files (x86)\check_mk\timestamp.$remote_host</tt><br>
This has been changed. The latest check_mk agent now provides additional environment variables

<ul>
<li>PLUGINSDIR</li>
<li>LOCALDIR</li>
<li>SPOOLDIR</li>
<li>MK_CONFDIR</li>
</ul>

and the script uses them accordingly.
