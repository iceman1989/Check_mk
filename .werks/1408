Title: mknotifyd now really reads all configuration files below mknotifyd.d
Level: 2
Component: notifications

Class: fix

Previously the notification spooler daemon <tt>mknotifyd</tt> just read the
single file <tt>etc/check_mk/mknotifyd.d/wato/global.mk</tt>. Now it reads
all files below <tt>etc/check_mk/mknotifyd.d</tt> - just as one would
expect. Note: there is still no <tt>etc/check_mk/mknotifyd.mk</tt> file.
