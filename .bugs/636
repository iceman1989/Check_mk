Title: Add missing fields to contact configuration
Component: wato
Class: todo
State: done
Date: 2012-02-22 19:40:24
Targetversion: 1.2.0

For example the mobile number field is missing. This is sometime a showstopper
since it is not possible to manually add further attributes. We even could
think about letting the user add custom attributes here. Or at least the
six supplement fields that nagios provides.
