Title: WATO clustered_services differs from cmk conf docs
Component: wato
Class: cleanup

Targetversion: 1.2.0

In WATO you don't see references to PHYSICAL_HOSTS etc. 
These special flags should either be deprecated / taken out of docs or added
to WATO. I'm confused if they're needed or not, but WATO and under-the-hood CM
should match.

This is an advanced command line feature and rarely used. Not needed int WATO.
