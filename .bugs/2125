Title: EventFilterState() based view filters handle all boxes unticked not as expected
Component: multisite

The view filter EventFilterState renders checkboxes of things, for example of states. If all boxes
are unchecked, the filter behaves like all boxes are checked -> no filtering. The user expects that
this filter setting makes the filter all rows out, means an empty result.

The current implementation might be confusing. Either make the filter work as expected or make the
filter aumomatically check all boxes when the last checkbox is unchecked. This should also show the
user that excluding all states is senseless.
