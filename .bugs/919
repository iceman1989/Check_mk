Title: Detect and warn about outdated checks in local/ hierachy
Component: core

Class: feature

It often happens that there are placed checks with changes/fixes in the
local/ hierarchy and left there. When an update applies those changes
and maybe get further changes, and the user does not remind, he would
use the local/ check for all the time.

It would be a nice feature to detect this somehow.
