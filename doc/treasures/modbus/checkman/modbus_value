description:
 This check is the first approach to monitor the Modbus. Modbus is an Industry Bus which
 can be used to query information. To get that information, you will find agent_modbus in
 the agent/special directory. This Check currently can handle gauge and counter data.
 If you set no levels, only a pnp graph will be created and the check anytimes shows {OK}.

inventory:
 One service will be created for each value

examples:
#Default levels 300, 350
modbus_value_default_levels = ( 300, 350 )
