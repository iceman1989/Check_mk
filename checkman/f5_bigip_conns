distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic managers)
 for the number of current connections {sysStatClientCurConns} and the number of current
 ssl connections {sysClientsslStatCurConns}.
 Warning and critical limits can be given for both types of data.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's tested against 9.3
 devices.

 The check is supported by WATO.

perfdata:
 At least two values: the number of current connections and ssl connections

[parameters]
parameters(dict): parameters is a dictionary with two keys {"conns"} and {"ssl_conns"}.
 The keys may be a tuple of warning and critical levels. However, when using predictive levels
 via WATO, the keys are dictionaries themselves with several keys and values.

[configuration]
f5_bigip_conns_default_levels(dict): This variable is preset to {{ "conns": ( 25000, 30000 ) }, "ssl_conns": ( 25000, 30000 )}
