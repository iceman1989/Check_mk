# A helper script that build a bridge between modern livedump 
# for state export while still using legacy NSCA as transport.
# if NSCA is not a strict requirement, walk on and try livedump!

# Advantages:
# - automagic detection of NSCA-enabled devices 
# - use one bulk transfer even with NCSA
# - can run every minute

# Disadvantages:
# - still using NSCA
# - still have to maintain the config on the NSCA receiver.


# Edit these parameters and the livestatus path to match your submission config
# or source them from your submit script.
