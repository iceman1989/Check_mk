description:
 This check monitors the reflock state of Meinberg LANTIME clocks supporting the
 MBG-SNMP-MIB::mbgLantime ({1.3.6.1.4.1.5597.3.1}) MIB. The check has been
 developed with a GPS170 M3x lantime V5.30k.

 The check handles the reported state of the refclock, the GPS signal and the number of
 satellites connected to.

 The check raises a {CRITICAL} when the refclock is in a bad state ({notavailable},
 {antennaFaulty} or {antennaShortcircuit}) and a {WARNING} state when the refclock is
 in one of the states {trackingSearching}, {warmBoot} or {coldBoot}.
 The GPS state raises a {CRITICAL} state when {not available} or {not synchronized} is
 reported by the device.
 It also handles a warning/critical threshold for the number of good satellites.

inventory:
 One check per device is created automatically.

[parameters]
good_warn (int): This is a lower threshold. When the number of good satellites drops
 below this value a {WARNING} state is raised.
 The default is set to {3}. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.
good_crit (int): This is a lower threshold. When the number of good satellites drops
 below this value a {CRITICAL} state is raised.
 The default is set to {3}. The threshold can be disabled by setting to {None}.

[configuration]
mbg_lantime_refclock_default_levels (int, int): A tuple ofintegers: The default
 levels. These levels are used for inventorized checks. This variable
 is preset to {(0, 0)}
