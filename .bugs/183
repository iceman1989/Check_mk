Title: Services with + in their names break PNP links
Component: multisite
State: wontfix
Date: 2011-03-22 15:25:58
Class: bug

The bluecoat sensors check creates checks with plus signs in the name, eg +12V bus voltage.
This seems to break the links/hovers to pnp. This might also be a problem in pnp.

The rrd files are named '+12V_bus_voltage.rrd'.

Need to be analyzed.

This seems to be a bug in PNP. Even in the PNP native
GUI services with a + in the name do not work. I've
contacted JÃ¶rg Linge...
