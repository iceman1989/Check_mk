Title: check-mk-agent package needs dependency to time package
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-09-06 09:36:53
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2

mk-job uses /usr/bin/time
this is included in package time (as well in CentOS as in Ubuntu)
package should require package time

2013-09-23 16:10:57: changed state open -> done
added dependency in check_mk.spec
tested positive on CentOS 6.4: pulls package time as depenency
tested on Ubuntu12.04: no negative issues found, package still installs
