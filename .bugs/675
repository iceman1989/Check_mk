Title: User is added to default contact group check_mk, but should not
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-04-10 16:30:42
Targetversion: 1.2.0

We did:
- Create a contact group "alle"
- Create a user "hh"
- Added "hh" to "alle"
- Created two hosts, but no rules for contact groups

Happened:
- The hosts are only in the contact group check_mk
- BUT: hh and omdadmin are members of check_mk automatically
  (and should not)
- and thus hh receives notifications, but should not
