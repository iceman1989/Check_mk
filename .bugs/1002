In the WATO as well as the multisite GUI views/topic can be hidden by clicking on the title.
This may confuse a user in some occasions, because it may not be clear if the topic is hidden, or
no item were found under that topic.
Therefore a triangle as indicator if the topic is hidden or not should be very useful.
