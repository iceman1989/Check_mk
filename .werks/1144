Rename service description of these checks. They now all begin with <tt>Temperature</tt>, such as
is custom for all Check_MK checks. Beware: new graphs will be created. If these services are target
of WATO or BI rules you might need to adjust them. Your WATO configuration for levels should work
without change.
