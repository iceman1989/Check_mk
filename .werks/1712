Title: hyper_vms: fixed for snapshot VMs with (...) in their names
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

When restoring snapshots then HyperV creates names like <tt>VM z4058044_snap
(23.05.2014 - 09:29:29)</tt>. These names had not been handled correctly by
neither the agent plugin nor the check. Both has been fixed. The check is
still compatible with the old agent output - and removes everying after
the <tt>_snap</tt> in the VM name. Thanks to Alexander Scholler.
