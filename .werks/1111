Title: vCenter monitoring: greatly improved performance (at least 40 times faster)
Level: 3
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1410518906
Class: feature

The pysphere API is no longer used when monitoring ESX vCenter systems.
We are now using much simpler tools to evaluate the vCenter response instead,
thus saving quite a lot of cpu time. Depending on the number of ESX Hosts and
virtualmachines you will see a performance increase by a factor of 40-200.

Note:<br>
If the "Compatibility mode" is set in WATO the old "pysphere" version is still being used.
This option remains for older (<5.0) ESX versions.
