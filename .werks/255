Title: windows_agent: now able to handle the removal of local/plugin scripts during runtime
Level: 1
Component: checks

Whenever a script got removed in the windows agents local or plugins directories,
the agent still tried to call this script, thus resulting in an error message in the
agent output. This has been fixed. Removed scripts no longer produce agent output.
