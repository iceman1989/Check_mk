title: State of Bonding network interface on Open vSwitch
agents: linux
catalog: os/networking
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks the current state of a Open vSwitch bonding interface.
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check gets critical. If at least one slave interface is down
 or not the expected slave is currently active, then the check
 gets WARN.

item:
 The name of the bonding interface, etc {bond0}.

inventory:
 One check per {active} bonding interface will be created. During inventory
 the currently active interface will be considered to be the primary
 interface. This is only relevant if you configure a detection of
 a change in the active interface.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): Currently two parameters are available in this dict:

 {"primary"}: The assumed primary interface. This is determined during
 inventory since Opoen vSwitch does not allow to configure a primary
 interface.

 {"expect_active"}: Which interface should be expected active. This is one
 of the following strings: {"primary"}: The interface set by the
 parameter {"primary"}, {"lowest"}: The interface sorting lowest
 alphabetically, {"ignore"}: Ignore which interace is active.
