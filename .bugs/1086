Title: Exception in views when EC views are missing
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: future

When you enabled the Event Console, modify an EC view and afterwards
disabled the EC again, then the views the modified views base on
are missing - and also the columns and filters. This leads to exceptions
in other views.

Solution: validate views, catch exceptions.

Has just been fixed. Only views for existing datasources are loaded into multisite now.
