Title: Visual colorization of availability according to levels
Level: 2
Component: reporting
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1383662920
Class: feature

The availability reporting has now a new option called <i>Visual levels for
the availability</i>.  Here you can define two percentual levels, which are
called <i>Warning</i> and <i>Critical</i>.  If these levels are enabled, then
the column <i>OK</i> or <i>UP</i> will be interpreted as the availability
of the object in question and the color will change to yellow or red, if
the actual percentual availability of that object is below those levels.

That way you can create a tabular report of several items that show whether
a certain availability has been reached.
