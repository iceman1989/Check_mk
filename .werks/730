Title: cmc: fixed bug displaying logentries after a logfile rotation
Level: 2
Component: core
Class: fix

The Check_MK microcore didn't cleanup cached logfiles correctly.
Thus caused missing logentries, when accessing views like
"Host and Service Events" or "Search global logfile".

The logentries itself were not lost, just unavailable in views.
The problem could be fixed by restarting (not reloading) the cmc.
