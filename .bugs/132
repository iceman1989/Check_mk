Title: WATO misses some Windows services

It seems that WATO is dropping some service when inventorizing
Windows hosts. Of course the problem is not Windows-related. But
it seems that services containing special characters, like ':'
could make the difference.

Should be fixed now. Was du to colons in service descriptions.
