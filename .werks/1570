Title: Fix notification of check_http active checks with Nagios core
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417627787
Class: fix

When using Nagios as the core and a check command that contains single
quotes then the notification would not work. This is because the variables
are enclosed in single quotes in <tt>check_mk_templates.cfg</tt>. That file
has been changed so that for the check command macros double quotes are
being used. Check_MK itself does never use double quotes in its strings
so this is less likely to cause problems.

The Check_MK Micro Core does not have this problem. Everything works
fine here.
