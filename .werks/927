Title: windows agent: now able to evaluate logfiles written in unicode (2 bytes per character)
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1401284347
Class: feature

The windows agent was unable to process logfiles which were written as unicode. Those files
had binary zeros every other byte, rendering the normal "readline" logfile processing useless.<br>
The agent can now read unicode files correctly, convert each line to a multibyte representation
(most of the time it is only a single byte) and apply the configured logfile patterns accordingly.
