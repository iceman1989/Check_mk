Title: jolokia agent: introduce timeouts
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2012-11-20 17:03:46
Targetversion: future
Class: nastiness

If one instance is e.g. out of memory then it does not answer timely on
the jolokia URL. The agent plugin needs to introduce a (short) timeout and
proceed then with the further instances. Otherwise the complete agent will
hang and the remaining checks missing.
