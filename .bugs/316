Title: more elegant handling of focus in multisite "command" tab
Component: multisite

when a user tabs over to "commands" to issue a downtime, enter a comment o
ge an issue the focus is per default on some rarely used field (downtime? enter
comment?).
it should be moved to acknowledge, at least
ideally, move the focus wander to the button related to the field that has recei
ved text
input. To follow in current ajaxed style, make it fancy and switch the bg colour
 of the
text box to highlight where input has been made.

colours ftw!
