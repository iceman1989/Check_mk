Title: bulletlink in sidebarsnapin: broken layout
Component: multisite

Since shortly the small blue bullets lefts to links
like in "Site status" are indented too much left (on 
Firefox). This could be the effect of fixing this for
IE and Chrome.

This should be solved now. I attached a ruler to the left contents of the snapins and even
on the right side of the centered snapins and it seems to be ok now in common browsers.
