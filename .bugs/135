Title: No config check on --help
Component: core
State: done
Class: cleanup

When calling check_mk --help the config check should
be skipped. Same holds for --version (and maybe others
like --packager).

We also could restrict the config check positively
to -C, -U, -R, -O (all code that actually influences
the productive Nagios daemon).

A positive list of options now prevent loading the configuration
