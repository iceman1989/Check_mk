Title: Livestatus now supports Nagios 4
Level: 3
Component: livestatus
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1391698284
Class: feature

It is now possible to compile livestatus for nagios4.
The <tt>setup.sh</tt> script from the check_mk tarball now autodetects
the nagios version and proposes it during the setup process.<br>
You can also choose the version manually (3 or 4).<br>
Depending on the chosen version livestatus includes the nagios headers from 3.2.0 or 4.0.2.<br><br>

If you just want to compile livestatus you can set the nagios version via an option in the configure script.<br>
<tt>configure --with-nagios4</tt>
