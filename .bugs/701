Title: Logout not working when configured cookie auth but using basic auth

Multisite can be configured to use cookie auth but uses basic auth when available. In this case
of implicit basic auth usage the logout functionality does not work since the page_logout() function
only takes the configured option into account.

This is a case of misconfiguration. There is no easy fix possible at the moment - closing.
