Title: windows agent: fixed crash on processing eventlog records
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389262775
Class: fix

On some instances the check_mk_agent crashed when formatting
eventlog messages. This was caused by message templates, which were
specified in dll files, expecting more formatting arguments than the
eventlog record provided.
