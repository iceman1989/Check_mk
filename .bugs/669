Title: Legacy checks prevent auto full scan in inventory
Component: wato
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.0

If you have configured legacy checks via rules then the
inventory of a new host will only work if you click on
"Full Scan" since the list of services of the host is
not empty. The condition for this should rather be "if the
host has no inventorized services".

Has already been fixed.
