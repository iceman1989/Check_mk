Multisite GUI dashboards has error affecting most views
Has been reported a few times and I could verify it.
Internal error:: 'module' object has no attribute 'wato_enabled'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/omd/sites/watotest/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/index.py", line 237, in handler
    handler()

    if fn == "filename" and not config.wato_enabled:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'wato_enabled'

WATO  still works, but most views are affected.
