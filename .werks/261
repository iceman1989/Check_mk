Title: df_netapp32 / df_netapp: Fixed bug with negative size in check output
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1390390390

The df_netapp and df_netapp32 checks tried to determine 64 bit counters by checking
the existance of the oid .1.3.6.1.4.1.789.1.5.4.1.29.1 (df64TotalKBytes).
Depending on the 64 Bit counter a df_netapp check is created, otherwise df_netapp32 is used.
Unfortunately not all netapp interfaces start at .1, so some netapp devices where wrongly
inventorized as df_netapp32 checks. <br>
Those checks reported negative volume sizes whenever the 32 bit counter overflowed.
