Title: Cluster requires same agent type as cluster node
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-06-19 09:46:28
Targetversion: future

If the agent type attribute of a cluster and its notes differs
the check_mk agent will fail

This is caused by the various is_tcp_host is_snmp_host precompiled functions
which return fixed values. The nodes receive the value of the cluster -
thus leading to the checks downfall.

Should work now.
