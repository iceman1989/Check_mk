Title: cisco_power, cisco_temp_perf: Both checks now using a new service description
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp

Class: fix

Both checks are supported by a wide range of cisco devices. Unfortunately the behavior of the devices is
not always the same. That means this devices not always return the same information via snamp.

Cause of this problems, it was necessary to change the information what was used as item for the service description.

After updating the Service description changes and a reinventory is needed.
