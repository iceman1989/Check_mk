Certain customers (ISP, or people with asymetric speeds on an inteface) put different focus
on interface monitoring - they don't need to detect the 1 out of 10000 clients that has heavy 
traffic, but they need to detect bw excess in either of two directions.
The check already tracks rx and tx but doesn't allow separate alerting like disk io would.
