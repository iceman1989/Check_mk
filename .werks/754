Title: Allow users to disable their notifications completely
Level: 2
Component: notifications
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1396619751
Class: feature

In the personal settings a user has now a convenient checkbox called
<i>Temporarily disable all notifications!</i>.  This disables <b>all</b>
notification for that user - regardless of wether plain, flexible or rule
based notifications are in use.

<b>Note:</b> Because this is a dangerous feature, it is protected with the
new permission <i>Disable all personal notifications</i>.  This permission
is switched <b>off</b> in the role <i>User</i> per default. If you like this
feature then you need to enable that permission.
