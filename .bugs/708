Title: should be able to clear logwatch status for multiple hosts
Component: multisite

Targetversion: future

if you receive events for a central failure, i.e. lan or san issues or a 
certain patch triggering errors on all systems, it would be very good to 
acknowledge the error for all system after you updated your filters
i didn't find a way to acknowledge log messages for more than a single host.
there might be hundreds of affected systems and it's overly complicated and
long to clear one by one.
