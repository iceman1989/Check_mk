Title: Login page shown (IE) while being logged in
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-01-16 13:06:47
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Test on IE: We use cookie based login and are logged in.
Now we enter http://192.168.56.1/walks/ in the URL field
of IE and hit enter -> the login form is being show.
Now we can simply click "Login" without entering any data
and are logged in.

The login form should not be shown in the first place here!

The login dialog now redirects the users to the requested page when the user is already logged in.
