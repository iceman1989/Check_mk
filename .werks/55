Title: Allow grouping by host, host group or service group
Level: 2
Component: reporting

Class: feature

Within the availability reporting there is now a new option <i>Grouping</i>
for grouping by host, host group or service group. When grouping is enabled
then one separate table will be rendered for each host or group that is part
of the selected objects. For objects that are not part of any group (well, this
cannot happen if you group by host) one additional table is being rendered.

The host and service groups are sorted according to their internal ID, but
their aliasses are being displayed. That way you can defined your custom
order of the groups in the report - by wisely choosing the internal IDs.

<b>Note</b>: objects that are part of more than one group will appear in
more than one table.
