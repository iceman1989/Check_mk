Title: zfsget: fixed problem with agent output of check_mk_agent.solaris
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: feature
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i2
Date: 1396438010

The reported columns from the check_mk_agent.solaris did not match
the columns expected in the check. This has been fixed.
Might have fixed problem with other agents than check_mk_agent.linux, too.
