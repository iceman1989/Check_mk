Title: bulk inventory in omd shared mode

At the moment the message about modifying the /etc/sudoers file is shown
on every cmk --automation problem during inventory. This is misleading.
The message should only occur when the entries are really missing in /etc/sudoers

Has just been fixed. The sudo hint message is only shown when the sudo command fails "sudo:
" in error message.
