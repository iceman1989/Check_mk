Try: set default_language = "de" in multisite.mk. But do not 
provide a language file. The result is an exception:

Internal error	None (/de)   13:54
index.py?debug=1
Internal error:: global name 'config' is not defined

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/omd/sites/opf/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/index.py", line 272, in handler

The inline comment was correct, but the code was wrong. Fixed it.
