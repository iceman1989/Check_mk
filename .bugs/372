We could implement a simple webservices that outputs the current
state of one, several or all BI aggregation groups. The output
format could be that needed for local checks. That way one
could make Nagios services out of BI aggregations by a simple
call to curl as a local check on the Nagios host.

We could also make the aggregations groups that should be output
confiurable in multisite.mk. And we could make that webservice
work without authentication from localhost (at least on OMD),
so that no artificial machine account needs to be created.

End of story: user just puts a file into /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local
and has his BI aggregations as nagios services.

One question still is how to configure the path to the web service
(i.e. the name of the OMD site).
