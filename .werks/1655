Title: AIX Agent: Fixed broken filesystem checks when having PowerHA installed
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

When installing PowerHA, a new filesystem is /aha is created and reported by
the Check_MK agent. This line seems useless and causes trouble duing checking.
We excluded this line now in the agent.
