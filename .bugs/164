Title: PNP template for local check should support multiple values
Component: checks
State: done
Class: bug

Currently only one value is painted. The best way would be probably
to call the PNP default template in case no special local template
is existent.

Beware: we must look in all template dirs for the default template.

Loop over all values and paint one graph for each value now. In 8 different nice colors.
