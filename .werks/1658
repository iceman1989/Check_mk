Title: agent_vsphere: no longer crashes when decommissioned vms report no hardware information

Class: fix

When a virtual machine gets decommissioned its hardware information (<tt>config.hardware.device</tt>) is
no longer reported. This caused the agent_vsphere to crash, unless all configuration files of this virtual
machine were removed.
