title: VMWare ESX host systems: Used space
agents: vsphere
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of the vsphere special agent in order to
 monitor the used space in datastores. It also displays this amount
 of (over) provisioning.

 This check is 100% compatible with normal filesystem check in all respects.
 Please refer to the manpage of {df} for details - except for the support for
 filesystem grouping.

item:
 The logical name of the filesystem (not the mountpoint!)

perfdata:
 See {df} for details

inventory:
 One service per datastore will be created.

[parameters]
params(dict): The check uses dictionary based parameters like specified for the
 {df} check. It extends those parameters, for example it makes use of the parameter
 {provisioning_levels} which are a tuple of percentage thresholds which are used
 against the current provisioning percentage value.
