Title: Add agent plugin to test local hostname resolving
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i6
Date: 1383212574
Class: feature

In release 1.2.3i5 the Check DNS option in WATO has been
cleaned up. It is only meant for really checking DNS servers,
not the local resolver of a system.
If you like to test the local name resolving on a specific
host, you can deploy the agent plugin "resolve_hostname"
on the host you like to run the check on. The name to be
resolved needs to be changed in the first lines of this
plugin.
