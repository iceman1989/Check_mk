Title: host_state (and others) are not treated as integers in log table
Component: livestatus
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-08-12 10:45:03
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2

Multisite assumes that columns like the host_state are integers.


GET log
Columns: host_state host_has_been_checked host_name service_max_check_attempts service_description service_current_attempt
Filter: class = 1
Stats: state = 0
Stats: state = 1
Stats: state = 2
Stats: state = 3
Stats: state != 0
OutputFormat: python

this results in [u"1",u"1",u"win7",u"1",u"Check_MK",u"1",0,0,1,0,1],
[u"1",u"1",u"win7",u"1",u"Check_MK inventory",u"1",0,0,0,1,1]]

we see host_state and host_has_been_checked and service_max_check_attempts as
strings which should really be integers.

This host_state results in an exception in views which use the alert statistics
datasource and have sounds enabled.

Internal error:: u'0'

--> We fix this in Multisite. Use saveint() here.

Seems to be fixed now. But there might be other places...
