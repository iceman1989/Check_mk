Title: Avoid multiple notifications for a single problem on a single host

you have e. g. a machine with some oracle instances
per instance there are multiple checks
now if one instance goes down, you get multiple notifications (one per check)
this is normally unwanted

in classical Nagios setups service dependencies are used to avoid these
but service dependencies have conceptual weaknesses
a notification may or may not be sent, depending on the timing of the both checks

as an alternative solution Mathias suggests:
Throw counter wrap exceptions in case a dependent service fails
dependent services should get stale in this case
but this means a check needs to know on which other services it depends
for the named oracle checks this should work fine

so let's try it this way
for other szenarios we might find a similar way
