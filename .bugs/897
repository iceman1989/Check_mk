Title: Add some security mechanism to prevent accidential removal of ldap users profile
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness

It might happen that users are not visible to the ldap sync (maybe by temporary
misconfiguration). When a sync detects that one user is suddenly missing, it
removes the user from the configuration as also the htpasswd mechanism does.
This could lead in bad situations where customized things in multisite get lost,
maybe we find a way to prevent this somehow...?

The profile folder deletion has been commented out a longer time ago. The problem should
be solved for the moment.
