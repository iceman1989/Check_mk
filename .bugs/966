Title: defunct and other entries on ps section of AIX agent confuse ps check
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2013-08-08 17:05:36
Targetversion: future

The section that needs to be reviewed is "<<<ps>>>".  I would prefer not to
post the entire agent output, but instead I will provide the relevant
section and offending entries.  The first entry below is a standard entry
that looks good.  It's the "defunct", "idle", and "exiting" entries that
the ps.check chokes on.  As a workaround, I have used "grep -v" on the
entries in my agent script to make sure they are not returned.  This is not
ideal as it would be awesome if the ps.check interpreted those entries and
possibly even included them in performance data.

<<<ps>>>
(root,776,180,0.0) /etc/init
(<defunct>,,,)
(<defunct>,,,)
(<idle>,,,)
(<exiting>,,,)

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

Thanks,
Dale

Current state is that the lines in question are simply being 
ignored and cause now trouble. Counting zombies and stuff could
be done, but is not a bug but a feature reqeust.
