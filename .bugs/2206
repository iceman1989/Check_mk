Title: Rework "crashed checks" mechanism
Component: core
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: todo

The optional crashed checks log should be replaced by a new mechanism
where each exception is written to a dedicated folder hierarchy like
HOST/SERVICE, where only the last exception is stored per service.
It is written as text file where all needed information like

a) the raw agent output
b) the raw SNMP data
c) the traceback

are written to.

This file can be downloaded from the Web-GUI by clicking on an icon
which is shown when there is some file for a service available.

The files are removed using the diskspace cleanup mechanism regularly.
