Title: postgres_sessions: make agent plugin compatible with PostgreSQL 9.2
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
State: unknown

Targetversion: future

Problem is that newer PostgreSQL versions have the column <tt>query</tt>
instead of <tt>current_query</tt>. The plugin now simply tries both
variants.
