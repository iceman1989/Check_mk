 Describe here: (1) what the check actually does, (2) under which
 circumstances it goes warning/critical, (3) which devices are supported
 by the check, (4) if the check requires a separated plugin or
 tool or separate configuration on the target host.

item:
 Describe the syntax and meaning of the check's item here. Provide all
 information one needs if coding a manual check with {checks +=} in {main.mk}.
 Give an example.  If the check uses {None} as sole item,
 then leave out this section.

 # Give examples for configuration in {main.mk} here. If the check has
 # configuration variable, then give example for them here.

 foo_default_values = (40, 60)

 # another configuration variable here:
 inventory_foo_filter = [ "superfoo", "superfoo2" ]

 Describe precisely the number and meaning of performance variables
 the check sends. If it outputs no performance data, then leave out this

 will it find? Describe the influence of check specific
