title: Number of pending windows updates and needed reboot state
agents: windows
catalog: os/misc
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check uses WMI to fetch the number of pending important and optional updates
 on a windows system. It also checks if a reboot is needed after installing updates.

 By default the check only fetches the information and never raises WARNING/CRITICAL
 states. But this can be configured.

 The windows agent needs to be extended with the {windows_updates.vbs} provided
 in {agents/windows/plugins}.

inventory:
 One service named {System Updates} is being created for each host.

perfdata:
 Two values important and optional which contain the number of pending updates.

[parameters]
imp_warn (int): Number of pending important updates to raise a WARNING state.
                Can be set to None for disabling the level.

                Can be set to None for disabling the level.
opt_warn (int): Number of pending optional updates to raise a WARNING state
                Can be set to None for disabling the level.
opt_crit (int): Number of pending optional updates to raise a CRITICAL state
                Can be set to None for disabling the level.
