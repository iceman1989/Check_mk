Title: Fixed "Inventory failed" message when trying an inventory on clusters via WATO
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1386758273
Class: fix

The service inventory of cluster hosts via WATO failed all the time with an error message
like "Inventory failed for this host: Error - host is unreachable, no usable cache file present".
This error has been fixed with this change.
A WATO-inventory on a cluster node also no longer removes previously detected clustered services.
