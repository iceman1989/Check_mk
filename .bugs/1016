the inventory data stored in var/check_mk/inventory are stored in a regular
text file as well as a gzipped version for the file. This is redundant, and
also may lead to problems when a hostname itself contains the postfix ".gz".
It also makes using scripts on the stored data inconvenient.  Data should
be stored either in gzip format, or in text files, not both.

On the other hand we need the gzipped file for fast replication. And we
need the unpacked files for fast access by the local Web-GUI.

A solution could be to use two different directories.
