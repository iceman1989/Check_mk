Title: check_mk_exit_status does not work for SNMP based devices
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

If you do checks on devices not switched on 24x7, you define a rule 
"Status of Check_MK Service", which sets check_mk_exit_status

For devices using the Check_MK agent, this works fine.
For devices using SNMP it does not work. 
But also maybe a printer (queried by SNMP) may be switched off during
none office hours.

This works at least for connection problems. Needs to be analyzed for
each case individually when it does not work.
