Title: configure first_notification_delay from WATO

Currently we don't have support for setting the first notification delay from within WATO. 
This is a helpful feature we recommended to many people, so it would be important to have it available;
I think it's the only notification-related setting not available in WATO, so by adding it we'd have 
it all covered.
