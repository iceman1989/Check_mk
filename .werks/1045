Title: Gracefully restart check_mk helpers in case of memory leak
Level: 2
Component: core

Class: fix

When using the Check_MK Micro Core in combination with inline SNMP then
in certain rare situations the check_mk helper processes leak memory. We
suspect the leak to be in the SNMP libs but this is just an assumption.

This fix now watches the size of each check_mk helper. If the memory usage
(VM size) of the process grows by more then 50% compared to the size after
the first 20 hosts being checked, then the helper silently restarts itself
and leaves a message in <tt>var/log/check_mk/cmc-helper.log</tt>.
