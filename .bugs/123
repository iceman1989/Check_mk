Title: Schedule downtime for host *and* services
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2011-02-08 14:28:43
Class: feature

In the commands box for the host where a downtime is set
we could add a checkbox [x] also for all services. If that
checkbox is set, we send a second command to nagios which
will set the downtime also on all services of the host
(SCHEDULE_HOST_SVC_DOWNTIME).
