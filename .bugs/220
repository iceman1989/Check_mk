Title: BI does not detect infinite recursions correctly
Component: core
State: wontfix

At the moment BI does not catch direct loops (an object pointing to itselfs) or indirect loops
(some childs object points back to a parent object).

In the first case the python error message is OK but in the second case the python error message
is not very clear.

Same as bug #204
