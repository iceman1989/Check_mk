The WATO rule for the CPU load does not allow to specify float values. But
since the level is multiplied by the number of cores this would be
neccessary. So convert from int to float. Does the ValueSpec float() accept
ints? If not, make it configurable such that it does or make an automatic
conversion, so WATO is happy with existing int-based rules.

Also fix the labelling: The level is multiplied by the number of Cores!
