Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415868493
Class: feature

All interface checks now allow to inventory just those ports whose
alias matches one of a list of regular expressions. These are a new
option in the WATO rule <i>Network Interface and Switch Port Inventory</i>.
This allows you to control which ports are monitored based on the alias
<b>without</b> using the alias as the service description.
