Title: Convert HTTP(S) links in plugin output into clickable icon
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384432725
Class: fix

The Multisite GUI now translates HTTP links that are contained in the output
of plugins into an icon that contains a clickable <tt>href</tt> to that link.
This feature has been introduced to allow at least basic HTML support in plugin outputs.
If you want to have full html support in plugin output (including the security risks it brings)
you can disable the option "Escape HTML codes in plugin output" in the global settings.
