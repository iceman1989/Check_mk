Title: Make PING timeouts configurable via main.mk
Component: core
State: open

Class: feature

The proposed way via extra_host_conf["check_command"] is possible
but difficult for many.

Better would be:

ping_levels = [ ( 200, 500, 40, 80 ), [ "wan" ], ALL_HOSTS ]

Wie would need to make the check-host-alive and check-mk-ping commands
take an argument $ARG1$ that would be appended to the command line
and would the infuse options like -w and -c there.
