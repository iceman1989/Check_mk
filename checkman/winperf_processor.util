title: CPU utilization on Windows systems
agents: windows

description:
 This check monitors the CPU utilization on a Windows system using the
 windows performance counters (agent section {winperf_processor}).
 This check replaces {winperf.cpuusage} which is outdated since version {1.1.11i1}

 Setting a level for warning or a critical state is possible, but might
 not be very usefull, since the computed value is an average over
 just one check cycle. Consider to set the {average} option for this purpose.
 A combination with a larger value of {max_check_attempts}
 or {notification_delay} might also be useful here.

perfdata:
  One or two values: the first value is current usage in percent - ranging from
  0 to 100. The "maximum" value is not 100, but the number of CPU threads. This
  case be used for scaling the graph in terms of the number of used CPU threads.

  If averaging is enabled then a second value is sent: the averaged CPU utilization
  ranging from 0 to 100.

inventory:
 A check of this type is automatically created for all Windows
 hosts.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): A dictionary with the following keys:

  {"levels"}: Either {None} for no levels, a tuple of warn and crit (in percent) or
  a dictionary with predictive levels settings.

  {"average"}: A number of minutes for enabling averaging.

[configuration]
winperf_cpu_default_levels(dict): Default levels, preset to { "levels": (101.0, 101.0) }
