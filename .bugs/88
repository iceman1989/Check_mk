Title: Move check_mk_templates.cfg to /usr/share/check_mk
Component: core
State: done
Class: cleanup
Date: 2011-01-04 13:51:15
Targetversion: 1.2.0

The directory /usr/share/doc is not optimal since the templates
are no longer an example but a vital part - usually never changed
by the admin.

2011-12-28 12:05:26: changed state open -> done
This is now implemented. Positive tests are still being waited
for.
