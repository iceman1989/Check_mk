Title: Creating WATO lock during automations (like e.g. master to slave syncs)

All actions within WATO which might modify config files are globally locked.
This prevents mixups in written files. Only the automation commands did not
use a lock which might lead into broken files when some manual action
and some pushed snapshot wrote a file at the same time. The automations
now use the same lock as user actions which should prevent such problems now.
