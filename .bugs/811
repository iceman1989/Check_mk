Title: Multisite does not display local check man pages
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-11-16 10:39:32
Targetversion: 1.2.0

If you install an MKP and it brings a check man page this man page is not 
displayed from Multisite, instead it gives an error about not finding the
check man page in the default path. It would be good if multisite could
also check the local/ structure for existing man pages

LM: This is already implemented, but with the nastyness, that the regular
check manpages are placed in share/doc/check_mk/checks but the local
check manpages are searched in local/share/check_mk/checkman. This should
be cleaned up!

This is already solved. I open a new bug for the path nastiness
