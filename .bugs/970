I am a happy user of MK LiveStatus. Thank you for such an excellent tool!

I would just like to bring a small problem to your attention. It seems that
on-demand macros are not expanded in *_expanded columns. For instance if I
have the following definitions:

define host {
        name                            cfg-archived
        register                        0
        notes_url http://$_HOSTFQDN:localhost$/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/$_HOSTSITE$/$HOSTALIAS$?view=markup
}

define host {
        host_name                       localhost
        _fqdn                           ngssrv.example.com
}

define host {
        host_name                       fl-sw-01
        _site                           florenc
        use                             cfg-archived
}

and I issue the following query:

GET services
Filter: host_name = fl-sw-01
Columns: notes_url_expanded

I get the following result:

http://$_HOSTFQDN:localhost$/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/florenc/fl-sw-01?view=markup

However, the result should be:

http://ngssrv.example.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/florenc/fl-sw-01?view=markup

Would you please consider looking into this issue?
