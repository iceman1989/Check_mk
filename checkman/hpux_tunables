title: Kernel tunables
agents: hpux
catalog: os/kernel

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check allows for monitoring of admin-tunable kernel limits on HP-UX
 systems that support the {"kcusage"} command. The command should be available
 from HP-UX 11.20 to the current 11.31.

 Typical tunables are the number of running processes or the number of
 semaphores for applications using IPC.
 The check can alert you if the usage of a certain tunable element exceeds
 a configurable threshold, which is set as a percentage.

 The supported tunables are:
   Number of processes               (npoc)
   Number of threads                 (nkthread)
   Number of open files              (maxfiles_lim)
   Number of IPC Semaphore IDs       (semmni)
   Number of IPC Semaphores          (semmns)
   Number of shared memory segments  (semmns)


inventory:
 {hpux_tunables} generates one check per host for each of the supported
 tunables.

examples:
 # Set the alert levels for the process table to 50% WARN, 60% CRIT:
 hpux_tunables_nproc_default_levels = (50.0, 60.0)

 checks = [
    # Enforce a check on all HP-UX machines for an alert at 16000 open
    # processes
    (["hp"], ALL_HOSTS, "hpux_tunables.maxfiles_lim", (16000, 20000)),
 ]

perfdata:
  The name of the tunable along with it's usage, threshold and warning /
  crit levels.

[parameters]
warn(float): Warning percentage for the tunables allocation
crit(float): Critical percentage for the  tunables allocation


[configuration]:
 Generally the checks only track the usage and a limit has to be defined
 using check_parameters.
 The checks {nproc} and {nkthread} come with pre-configured default levels:

hpux_tunables_nproc_default_levels (float, float):
  The percentage of running processes compared to the kernel limit for running
  processes.

hpux_tunables_nkthread_default_levels (float, float):
  The percentage of threads of running processes compared to the kernel limit
  for running threads.
