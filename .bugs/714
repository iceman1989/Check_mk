Title: PostgreSQL check breaks on version 9 output
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: closed
Date: 2012-06-26 14:14:46
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Currently we do not support output from version 9 PostgreSQL. 
They send one more data field and our agent sends with " " as separator
Fix should detect output format and then also handle postgresql 9

Methinks (flo) that we should 
 - not fetch the stats_reset timestamp at all since we dont need it
 - not use -F' ' but -F'somethingelse'

Bug should be fixed now. 
They added a field for last stats reset which we don't need but still fetched.
Agent now selects only defined fields and uses sep:() in case we run into this situation again.
