If you add a simulated state for a given service (using foldable) it will be
reflected on the top-level, but not on the nodes.  So you see a lot of green
items and but the main state stays as configured to be simulated it's very
irritating, since the correct subaggrs and services are in fact displayed,
just not with their simulated states.
