If you are using the BI aggregation function <tt>count_ok</tt> then nodes
with the state <tt>PEND</tt> (which essentially means unmonitored or not
present) are handled differently from now.

If <b>all</b> nodes are pending then the total state will also be pending.
If just some of the nodes are pending then they will not taken into account.
This is especially imported when doing availability computations on
BI aggregates.
