Title: Check_MK inventory service has been renamed to Check_MK Discovery
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417704691
Class: fix

For new installations (using WATO), the former "Check_MK inventory" service
has been renamed to "Check_MK Discovery". This has been done to clarify
the difference between the service discovery (find new things to monitor)
and the hw/sw inventory.

Existing installations are not affected by default, but can switch to the new
name by checking "Monitor hosts for unchecked services (Check_MK inventory)"
in the Global Setting "Use new service descriptions".
