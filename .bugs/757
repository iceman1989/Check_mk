Title: Compilation of livecheck with dietlibc broken on SLES11SP1/2
Component: livecheck
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2012-05-25 10:28:46
Targetversion: future

Generally we should enable compiling livecheck with dietlibc in
all of our OMD builds (where diet is available). An then fix
the compile problem currently arising:

cc -nostdlib -static -L/opt/dietlibc/lib-x86_64
/opt/dietlibc/lib-x86_64/start.o -g -O2 -I.. -s -o livecheck l
ivecheck.c strutil.cc check_icmp.c -isystem /opt/dietlibc/include
-D__dietlibc__ /opt/dietlibc/lib-x86_64/libc.
