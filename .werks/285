Title: Fixed bookmarking of absolute URLs or PNP/NagVis URLs in sidebar snapin
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385367764
Class: fix

In previous versions, the URLs not pointing to multisite pages, bookmarked with
the sidebar snapin, could not be used, as they pointed to non existing URLs. This
was caused by th URL shortening algorithm used within the bookmark snapin.
