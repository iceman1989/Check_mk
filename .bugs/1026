Title: Postfix mailqueue check should use more flexible thresholds
Component: checks

The check is currently only using absolute levels, which is OK for the first moment, but
in fact it is not really a problem when having several hundret mails in the queue, as long
as all mails are processed after a short time. Only a queue which remains filled is
a problem. Some kind of dynamic calculation should be better, a rate or similar.
