description:
 This check monitors the rotation speed of a power fan in an IBM
 blade center. If the current speed drops below the configured levels
 then the check results in a warning or critical
 state. Also, if the fan is not present or the controller state
 is not OK, the result is critical.

item:
 Index number of the fan (as string)

inventory:
 All present fans are detected automatically and parameterized with
 levels at 50 (WARN) and 40 (CRIT) percent of maximum speed.

perfdata:
  Two values: The current percentage of the maximum design speed and the
  current speed in RPM.

[parameters]
warning (int): percentage of the maximum speed, at and below which a warning
  is triggered.
critical (int): percentage of the maximum speed, at and below which a critical
  state is triggered.
