Title: agent_vsphere / check_mk agent: fixed outdated systemtime of check_mk agent

The systemtime of the check_mk agent was incorrect most of the time whenever the
agent_vsphere was used together with the classic agent.
The reason was that the agent_vsphere program was called after the check_mk agent
- its execution took several seconds - thus leading to an outdated systemtime of the standard agent.
