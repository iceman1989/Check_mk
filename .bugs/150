Title: Display options show wrong value at start

When you enter a view where the display options for the PNP timerange
had been set to 4 hours (which is persistet), then the graphs are
showing 4 hours. Good. But when you open the tab "Display Options",
the dropdown is preset to 25h (which is the default), rather then
to 4h (which is the current setting).

Fixed. Using get_painter_option function now to retrieve the configured value
