Title: Multisite can now set rotation view permissions for NagVis
Level: 1
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i1

Class: feature

When using multisite to controll the users permissions within NagVis,
the read access to rotations could not be controlled via Multisite.
The permission for this has been added now. This change only applies
when used with the newest NagVis version (currently daily build).
