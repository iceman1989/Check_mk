description:
 This check monitors the state of the inlet sensors of the Raritan PX-2000
 family of intelligent rack power distribution units (iPDUs).
 The check displays the measured value of the sensor.

item:
 One item named Summary.

perfdata:
 Five values: Voltage, current, power, apparent power and energy

inventory:
 One check per phase is created.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check supports four types of parameters,
none of which have default values. It is a dictionary with the following keys:

 {"voltage"}: Warning and critical levels for voltage in int, denoting the minimum required voltage in volt.

 {"current"}: Warning and critical levels for current in int, denoted in Amp√®re

 {"power"}: Warning and critical levels for power in int, denoted in Watt.

 {"appower"}: Warning and critical levels for apparent power in int, denoted in AV.
