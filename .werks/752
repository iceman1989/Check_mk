Title: FIX: compute correct state transitions for notifications
Level: 2
Component: notifications
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i3

This fixes a problem with the combination of
<ul>
<li>Rule based notifications</li>
<li>Maximum check attempts &gt; 1</li>
<li>Rule conditions based on the <i>original</i> state of a host or service</li>
</ul>

When a service got CRIT while having more than one check attempt, the previous
(soft) state would be displayed as CRIT, while it is OK in fact. This has
been fixed natively when using the Check_MK Micro Core. When using Nagios then
during the notification the previous hard state is not always known. In doubt
a notification is being sent out rather then omitted.
