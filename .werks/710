Title: Create a history entry for events that failed their target count
Level: 1

Class: feature

When a counting rule sees the first matching message, then an entry in the history
is logged with the type <tt>NEW</tt>. When the event did not reach the configured
number of required message within the configured time then no history entry was
logged. Now an entry of type <tt>COUNTFAILED</tt> is being logged and you can see
the count of messages received so far in that entry.
