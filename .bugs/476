Title: mounts check should only check ro flag
Component: checks
State: done
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.0

Currently on my laptop the mounts check is flapping around because
the kernel seems to add a mount option with "commit" and change
it all the time. Basically we'd need to just monitor the ro
status.

Another idea is to consolidate the check into one single
check. This is difficult - however - because we need to 
safe one per-filesystem parameter: the expected options.

commit is now excluded.
