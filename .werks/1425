Title: New section header option "encoding" for agent output
Level: 1

Class: feature

If you write your own check plugins you might know that a section
header can contain additional options separated by a colon.
For example:

For section headers of agent outputs an additional option <tt>encoding</tt>
has been introduced.  Generally all check plugins should output valid UTF-8
encoded text.  In some instances this is not possible, because the plugin
itself has its own hardcoded encoding. With the encoding option you can
specify the encoding for this entire section. Check_MK will then decode the
given section output and recode it into UTF-8 for further processing.
Example:

F+:
<<<win_foobar:encoding(cp1252)>>>
F-:
