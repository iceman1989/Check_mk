Title: GUI Notify: Added notify method "popup" to really create popup windows
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384266662
Class: feature

The messages were named popups before, but were not really poups, as they were
only shown at the bottom of the sidebar as small hints. Both functions are now
available as notification methods. Popups will show up as alert windows and be
marked as read after closing the alert window and hints are only shown at the
bottom of the sidebar now.
