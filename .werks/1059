Title: LDAP: Using configured user filter during login to prevent temporary created users
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1405600906
Class: fix

When a LDAP user that is not allowed to log in to multisite according to the
"LDAP User Settings" OU and filtering options tries to login with valid credentials
Multisite created a temporary user entry just to remove it later during the login
process. The user can not access Multisite, but an error message is shown and a
log entry in the WATO audit log is being created.

This has been changed that the initial credentials check takes the filters from
"LDAP User Settings" into account. Leaving all not permitted users with the message
"invalid credentials".
