Title: brocade_fcport: cope with firmware that does not provide speed information
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389188713
Targetversion: future

Some newer firmwares of Brocade switches do not output information about the
port speed anymore. That caused the check to fail. We now silently assume
auto negotiation in that case (which means 2Gbit/s if you haven't configured
this otherwise)
