title: veeam client backup check
agents: windows
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the status of backups of clients carried out by the Veeam
 backup tool. In order to carry out the checks, the Veeam agent plugin
 needs to be installed on the backup server. See special instructions in the
 comment section of the two Veeam agent plugin scripts on how to install
 the scripts.

 The plugin sends data for all virtual machines as piggyback data in the agent
 output of the backup server.

 This check is {OK} if the status of the backup is {success}, {Pending}
 or {InProgress}. It is {WARN} if the status is {Warning}. It is {CRIT}
 if the status of the backup is {Failed}.

 In addition {WARN} and {CRIT} levels can be set for the time since the end
 of the last backup.

examples:
 # sets the warning and critical levels to 5 and 10 days, respectively
  veeam_client_default_levels = { "age": ( 432000, 864000 ) }

perfdata:
 Total Size, duration and the average speed of the backup will be recorded
 as performance data. Duration will not be recorded if the status of the backup
 is {Pending} or {InProgress}.

inventory:
 A check will be created for all hosts known to check_mk and reported
 by the Veeam agent plugin.
