Title: Makefiles von REDHAT/CENTOS 6.4 - Missing packages
Component: core
Class: nastiness
State: works4me
Date: 2013-03-19 11:28:02
Targetversion: 1.2.3

The following packages need to be installed manually after ./configure has been called
xorg-x11-server-Xvfb
python-ldap
They are only set in OS_PACKAGES, but probably needed in BUILD_PACKAGES

But what happens if they are missing? Are they needed during compilation?

I see no reason why this should result in a problem. Please provide error output if this is really a problem.
