2. Click on "Deployments" and then "Install"
3. Click on "upload your file(s)" and upload the WAR file 
   from jolokia.org (e.g. jolokia-war.1.0.3.war)
4. [Next]
5. Check and maybe modify the installation path
6. Install this deployment as an application
7. Available targets: select Servers where to install and [Next]
8. Optional settings: leave everything at defaults and hit [Next]
9. on the next page ("Review"): [Finish]
10. Now change the context root: Got to "Configuration" and
   fill in "/j4p" into the field "Context Root" and save

If everything went right, then you should be able to get
some basic JSON information via the following URL:

http://NAME:PORT/j4p
