Title: Automatically schedule inventory check after service config change
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385731404
Class: feature

Now after each change of the service configuration of a host via WATO -
may it be via manual changes or a bulk inventory - the inventory check
is automatically rescheduled in order to reflect the new service state
correctly immediately.

You can switch off this behaviour via a new global option called <i>Inventory
triggers inventory check</i>. The default setting is <b>on</b>.
