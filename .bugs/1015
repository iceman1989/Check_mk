When HW/SW-Inventory is set to be applied to a group of hosts,
clusters should be automatically excluded
since it does not make sense to include them in the inventory.

Problem: it is not clear of how to implement this. Check_MK rules
always apply to all hosts. Inventory is just one active check -
like many others. We would need a general enhancement for all
rules. Or we might restrict all active checks to physical
nodes. It <b>could</b> be helpful, however, to place something
like HTTP checks to cluster nodes that have IP-addresses,
though.
