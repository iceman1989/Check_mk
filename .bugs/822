Title: RPMs contining a 64bit Version of waitmax
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-01-11 16:01:24
Targetversion: 1.2.2

The check_mk-agent 1.2.1i3 and i4 RPMs erroneously contain a 64-bit waitmax binary, and thus cause problems on 32-bit Linux systems.
Ticket ID: 645082

Our build system had no "diet" install - thus created no static binary.
