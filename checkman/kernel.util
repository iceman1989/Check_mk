title: CPU utilization
agents: linux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the CPU utilization during the last check
 cycle. Levels can be set on the total utilization and also
 specifically on the disk wait (IO wait).

perfdata:
 Three variables: The percentage of time spent in {user}, {system} and {wait}
 (disk wait). The idle time can be computed by substracting those three values
 from 100%. The user value contains also {nice}.

inventory:
 One check per host is created if the agent contains a {kernel}
 section containing cpu information. The inventory creates the
 check with the parameter {kernel_util_default_levels}, which is
 preset to {None} thus imposing no levels and making the check always OK.

[parameters]
dictionary: A dictionary for two keys, both of which are optional:

  {"iowait"} a pair of float values with percentages for warning and critical
  for the disk wait

  {"util"} a pair of float values with percentages for warning and critical
  for the total utilization

[configuration]
kernel_util_default_levels (dictionary): Default levels used by inventorized
  checks. The default is not to impose any levels.
