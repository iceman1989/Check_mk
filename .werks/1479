Title: liveproxyd: new function for collecting remote inventory data
Level: 2
Component: inv

Class: feature

The Livestatus Proxy Daemon has now a new function for collecting HW/SW-Data
from remote sites. This needs up-to-date versions of Nagios or CMC on these
sites, otherwise the proxy daemon will fail to consider these sites as up! So
if you update the liveproxd you also need to update your remote sites!

Note: The new feature only works in OMD based installations. After updating
all sites to the new version, HW/SW-Inventory data collected on remote
sites that are connected via liveproxyd will automatically be transferred
to the central site.
