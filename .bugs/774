Title: Option "hide names of configuration variables" works only after switching
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-06-15 13:53:06
Targetversion: 1.2.0

The configuration variable is - per WATO - default off. But
in fact the real default value seems to be True. So 
in order to see the variable names you need to toggle
once on and off again.

Fixed WATO option definition
