Title: Fix wrong percentual host availability > 100% when excluding downtimes
Level: 2
Component: reporting

When you chose to exclude scheduled downtimes from the "100%" then hosts with
actual downtime periods could get an availability for more then 100%. This has
been fixed. The Settings <i>ignore</i> and <i>honor</i> were not affected. Also
not the display of absolute time values.
