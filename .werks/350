Title: nfsmounts: correctly handle mount points with spaces

If you have a space in the name of your <b>moint point</b> (not in the name
of the export) then the Linux agent would show this mount point always as
<tt>hanging</tt>. The reason is that in <tt>/proc/mounts</tt> spaces are
displayed as <tt>\040</tt>. This has now been fixed in the agent, which
outputs spaces correctly. Also the according check has been modified so that
it can deal with spaces in the names of the mount points.
