Title: SNMP scan gets OID twice

In some scan functions 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 is used, in other
ones .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0. Therefore the OID is fetched twice.
Either fix all checks or automatically normalize OIDs to
always or never begin with a dot.

All checks are now normalized to using .1.3.6.1 (with dot)
