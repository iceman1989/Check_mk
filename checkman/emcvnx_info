description:
 Reports information about Model, Revision and Serial Number on EMC VNX
 storage systems.

 The check always returns {OK}.

 The information is retriefed by the special agent agent_emcvnx which uses
 EMC's command line tool naviseccli.

 The full information is only available if you did switch on the "Model and
 Revsion" switch in the WATO rule "Check state of EMC VNX storage systems" or
 did call the special agent (as datasource program) with --modules option
 including "agent" module. If you are not interested in Model and Revision of
 your Storage device you can switch this off and save one call of naviseccli in
 every check interval. In this case the Check reports only the serial number
 of the SP.

 Finds exactly one check on every EMC VNX storage system called EMC VNX Info
