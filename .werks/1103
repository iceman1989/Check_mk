Title: windows agent: now able to omit context text of logfiles
Level: 1

Class: feature

You can now configure whether the context of the logfiles should be
sent too, if a ok/warn/crit logline was detected within the logfile.

The context includes lines starting with '.' (default context) or 'I' (ignored lines).

A new option <tt>nocontext</tt> has been introduced for the logfiles section in the <tt>check_mk.ini</tt> file.

F+:check_mk.ini
[logfiles]
    # The following textfile will not report any context info (nocontext option)
    textfile = nocontext C:\tmp\memo.udf

    # Set patterns for defined textfile
    warn = *overdue*
    ok = *mail sent*
F-:

If you simply prepend the parameter <tt>nocontext</tt> to the actual path (or path pattern),
all files matching this pattern will exclude any context info.
