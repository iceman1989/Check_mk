Title: windows_agent: now reports extended process information (obsoletes psperf.bat plugin)
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389878653
Class: feature

The ps section of the windows agent now provides additional information regarding processes.<br>
# (user, virtual_size, resident_size, %cpu, processID, pagefile_usage, usermodetime, kernelmodetime, openHandles, threadCount) processName<br>
#(\\KLAPPRECHNER\ab,29284,2948,0,3124,904,400576,901296,35,1)    NOTEPAD.EXE<br>
<br>
Previously you had to use the windows agent plugin psperf.bat to achieve the same amount of data.<br>
Since this data is now reported by the agent itself, the psperf.bat plugin becomes obsolete.<br>
In fact any data from psperf.bat will now be ignored in the ps check whenever the windows agent reports extended process information.<br>
<br>

Additional fixes and features
<ul>
<li>The agent now also reports its build date, apart from its version</li>
<li>Bugfix: The virtual and resident memory shown in the check output is now correct.
There were problems whenever there were multiple processes with the same name</li>
</ul>
