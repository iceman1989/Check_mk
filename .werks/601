Title: printer_alerts: check can now display a textual representation of the alert code

If a description of the the alert group state is not available from the device, the check
now displays a textual representation of the alert code instead of the alert code itself.
This makes the service output more readable and useful to the printer admin.

With this change the printer_alerts_state_map is deprecated and will no longer be used.
