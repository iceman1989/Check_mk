Title: Linux multipath check can now use the alias instead of the UUID as item
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: feature

If you have set useful aliasses for you Linux multipath devices then you can
now have Check_MK use these instead of the UUIDs for the service description.
This makes alerting, BI aggregates and other stuff easier. The configuration
is via a new rule set <i>Linux Multipath Inventory</i>. If you are now using
WATO then please refer to the check's man page for details.
