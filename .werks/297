Title: mk-job is now also usable on CentOS 5+
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385998226
Class: fix

The mk-job script failed with an error on CentOS 5+ systems,
because the /usr/bin/time command does not support the "--quiet"
option. This option seems to be useless when writing to a file,
therefor we removed this option now.
