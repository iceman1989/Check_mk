Title: Can use contact groups without hosts/services assigned in RBN rules now

Class: fix

Contact groups without hosts/services assigned could be configured, but not
used when using Nagios as monitoring core. This has been fixed now. You can
now safely configure all existing contact groups as recipients for notifications.
