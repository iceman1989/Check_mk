title: General state of DR:BD devices
agents: linux
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the contents of {/proc/drbd} as sent by the Check_MK linux
 agent. The check analyzes the "Connection State", "Disk State" and "Roles of
 the single nodes.

 The check takes a snapshot from the state during the inventory and compares
 it with the state during the checks. If some of the values differ from the
 inventorized values a CRITICAL state will be shown.

item:
 The name of the DRBD device e.g. {drbd0}

examples:
 # Set expected "cs" to "Connected", first node to primary and second to secondary
 # and both nodes to up-to-date.
 checks += [
   ( 'srvnd01', 'drbd', 'drbd0',
        {'diskstates_inventory': ['UpToDate', 'UpToDate'], 'roles_inventory': ['Primary', 'Secondary']}
   )
 ]

 # Set Primary/Primary setup to OK, Secondary/Primary to WARN
 # Set the diskstate "Inconsistent" to OK for Primary and Secondary
 checkgroup_parameters['drbd'] = [
 ( {'roles': [('primary_primary', 0), ('secondary_primary', 1)],
    'diskstates': [('primary_Inconsistent', 0), ('secondary_Inconsistent', 0)]}, [], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES ),
 )

inventory:
 Each configured DRBD device will result in one service during inventory. All
 devices with the connection state "Unconfigured" are skipped.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): A dictionary with the following keys
roles_inventory (list): The state of the drbd roles during the inventory (see example)
roles_diskstates (list): The state of the drbd diskstates during the inventory (see example)
roles (list of tuple): The expected roles and its state. Can also be set to None (instead of list) to disable
 alerting on this value.
roles (list of tuple): The expected role/diskstate value and its state. Can also be set to None (instead of list) to disable
 alerting on this value.
