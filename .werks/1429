Title: Disabled snmp checktypes are now sorted out before Check_MK contacts the snmp host
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1414574411
Class: fix

Behaviour in the previous version: If a snmp host should be inventorized it was checked
with the full palette of all available snmp inventory functions. The filtering of unwanted checktypes
was done afterwards. This caused needless snmp queries towards the snmp host.

The filtering of unwanted checktypes is now done before the snmp host is contacted.

Note: This only applies to the WATO rule <i>Disabled checktypes</i> respectively the parameters
<tt>ignored_checktypes</tt> and <tt>ignored_checks</tt>, but not to <i>Disabled services</i>.
The latter one matches to service descriptions which are the result of a successful inventory.
