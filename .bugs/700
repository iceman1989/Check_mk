Title: Multisite auth_type can not be changed in WATO
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness
State: wontfix
Date: 2012-07-09 09:31:16
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Seems the config option has not been added.

LM: Maybe this has been excluded for a good reason: To
    activate the basic auth there is also some apache config
    modification needed.
