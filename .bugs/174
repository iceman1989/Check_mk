Title: Reinventory removes e.g. snmp_info check when not given via cmdline

When a service has been added with --checks info -I <hostname> and one executes
a re-inventory for all checks then snmp_info check is lost and needs to be re-added with
--checks snmp_info -I or --checks snmp_info -II.

What could be a solution? Possible are:

- Do not remove checks without a a scan function on -II.
  But how do we know that there is no scan function? Or just
  remove checks with a positive result of the scan function?
  Sound complicated to implement.
  Maybe add an option -III which then removes all? Or depend
  on --flush for removing all autochecks.

  Problem is anyway: Check without a scan function do not
  work well (at all) in WATO. 

- Make a scan function for snmp_info and friends and
  propose ignored_checktypes in the Migration notes.

Added scan functions. Will add a note to the migration notes
of how to disable the check.
