Title: LDAP Updates creates Auditlog entries with random user names
Component: multisite
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.3i3
Class: nastiness

Due to the cache every couple of minutes a random user might trigger
an LDAP update and thus an entry in the audit log with his/her username.
Better leave the user empty here or add some dummy entry.
