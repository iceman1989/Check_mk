Title: wmic_if.ps1: Powershell version of the wmic_if.bat script
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1410264432
Class: feature

The new script wmic_if.ps1 should deliver the same information like the
wmic_if.bat script, but more reliable. In Win2012 the wmic_if.bat script
is unable to determine the correct interface speed for teaming interfaces.
This script is able to do so.<br>
Note: Do not use both plugins at the same time
