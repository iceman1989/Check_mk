Title: if checks: Add 0 prefix on port numbers below 10
Component: core
State: done
Class: todo
Date: 2011-02-11 11:17:50
Targetversion: 1.2.0

When monitoring switches the services are ordered as follows:

1
10
11
12
..
2
20

It would be good to cleanup such interface names by adding a leading zero to
the numbers to have a proper sorting of the elements. We can make it like
in the brocade checks: As we know the total number of ports we can decide
whether to use 2, 3 or 4 digits.

Because there are switches with more than 100 ports we could first
get the number of ports and then use even more zeroes if neccessary.
Look at brocade_fcport for details.

Also we could make this configurable in order not to break existing
checks.
