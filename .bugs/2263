Title: Cannot configure SNMPv3 directly as host attribute

If you have a community entered in a folder then you cannot override single hosts
in that folder to use v3. We need the SNMP configuration for v3 also in the host
attributes - the complete ValueSpec for SNMP credentials and not only the community
string.
