Title: LDAP: Improved slightly missleading logging of LDAP sync actions
Level: 1
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i4
Date: 1401863855
Class: fix

In some situations a call to WATO issued by the user are causing LDAP syncs,
for example when a user starts the sync interactively or the cache lifetime
has exceeded. In the past, the name of the triggering user was logged
to the audit / pending log, which was a bit missleading. Now, the name
of the user is not logged anymore.
