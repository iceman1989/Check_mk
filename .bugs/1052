Title: CUPS print queue monitoring: Default Printer is not checked / inventorized
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-09-16 08:52:34
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2

after a change in the linux agent, all printers are monitored / inventorized
except the default printer, having a
<DefaultPrinter sw>
section in /etc/cups/printers.conf

execution time optimization can be done within the change:
lpstat -a
command should not be executed twice, but only once
(whereas the lpstat -p and lpstat -o commands can be done once per printer)

2013-09-30 18:32:21: changed state open -> done
fixed with commit 7575f6df5402533d19a8c31e8000a4673905b419
