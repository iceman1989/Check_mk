Title: Logwatch: context lines can now be disabled using nocontext=1
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384783276
Class: feature

Each line which comes together with a line matching a logwatch pattern
is proceeded to the monitoring host as context line. This can now be
disabled using the linux agent plugin by adding the option "nocontext=1"
to the header line of a logfile configuration in logwatch.cfg
