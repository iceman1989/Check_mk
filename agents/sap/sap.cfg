# A list of strings, while the string must match the full path to one or
# several monitor objects. We use unix shell patterns during matching, so
# you can use several chars as placeholders:
#
# *      matches everything
# ?      matches any single character
# [seq]  matches any character in seq
# [!seq] matches any character not in seq
#
# The * matches the whole following string and does not end on next "/".
#
# Here some examples of monitor paths:
