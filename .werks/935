Title: CPU utilization: increased maximum value to 10000
Level: 1
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i4
Date: 1402394358
Class: fix

The maximum value for the CPU utilization in the WATO rules "State and count of processes"
and "Process inventory" was set to 101 percent. There were some instances where this value was higher than this limit.
For example if an application used multiple CPUs or the utilization value was calculated for a group of processes.
