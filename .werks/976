Title: Show preview of active and custom checks in WATO services table
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1400679742
Class: feature

In the list of the services of a host now also for active and custom checks
(i.e. non Check_MK-services) the output of the check plugin is being
displayed. This is done by a Check_MK executing the check plugin with the
configured arguments instead of the monitoring core.

This can be used to test the outcome of check plugins before any changes
are being activated.

Note: because of issues with permissions and pathnames this feature only
works on OMD based platforms.
