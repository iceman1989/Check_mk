Title: liveproxyd: keep site closed for a while after an error
Component: livestatus
Class: todo
State: done
Date: 2013-10-09 18:48:24
Targetversion: 1.2.3i3

When the livestatus proxy daemon cannot connect to a site
for any reason, or if a heartbeat fails, it should mark
that site dead for a certain time (e.g. 30 seconds). Maybe
we even binary backoff this time each time a problem
occurrs. That way we tackle:

- flapping connections
- problems with permament errors (cannot resolve hostname)

There already is such a setting.
