description:
 This checks monitors a UPS that supports the generic UPS-MIB,
 such as General Electric (GE) SitePro UPS, and many more.
 The check monitors
 the time the UPS is on battery (in seconds),
 the battery capacity (in percent),
 and the remaining runtime (in minutes).
 Warning and critical levels can
 be given for the remaining run time for the capacity.

perfdata:
 The remaining runtime in minutes and the capacity in percent

inventory:
 One service per UPS will be created.

examples:
 ups_capacity_default_levels = {
     'battime': (20, 40),
     'capacity': (90, 80)
 }


[configuration]
ups_capacity_default_levels(dict): This variable is preset to {{ 'battime': (0, 0), 'capacity': (95, 90) }}


[parameters]
parameters(dict): A dictionary with with the keys {battime} and {capacity}?

    {battime} is a tuple containing warning and critical levels for the
    time in minutes that the USV is estimated to have remaining runtime.
    Default levels are {(0, 0)}.

    {capacity} is a tuple containing the warning and critical levels for
    the battery capacity in percent. Default levels are {(95, 90)}
