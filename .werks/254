This feature allows to configure how spaces of VMs of ESX should be treated.
Hostnames in the monitoring core generally are not allowed to contain spaces.
The new option <tt>-S</tt> (configurable via the WATO rule <i>Check state
of VMWare ESX via vSphere</i>) can now set how to handle these spaces:

<table>
<tr><th>Option</th><th>Behaviour</th></tr>
<tr><td class=tt>-S cut</td><td>The virtual machines name is cut after the first space</td></tr>
<tr><td class=tt>-S underline</td><td>All spaces of this virtual machine are replaced with underline</td></tr>
</table>
