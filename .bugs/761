Title: ValueSpec ListOf breaks during user input error
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-30 10:23:56
Targetversion: 1.2.0

When an element of a ListOf() raises a user validation
error then the total ListOf() seems to fall back to its
original value - for example I've added a value and then
changed its position to top and then saved.

Repaired.
