Enable the sound configuration in config.py per default. Change
the comments in the example multisite.mk or remove that part
completely. Update the documentation.

Sounds are now enabled per default. And I've made a new
configuration variable enable_sounds which only must be
set to False in order to disable them. The list config.sounds is
preset to useful defaults.
