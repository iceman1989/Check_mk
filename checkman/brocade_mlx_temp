description:
 Checks the temperature sensors of one module in Brocade NetIron MLX / FGS / ICX switching /
 routing devices.

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if at least one of the temperatures is above given
 thresholds.
 {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 The description of the module together with its ID as provided by SNMP.

examples:
 # set default levels to 30°C and 40°C:
 brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels = (30, 40)

 # Check sensors of Switch Fabric module 0 on a box called my-mlx-device with
 # default levels
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.temperature", 'Switch Fabric Module 35', brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels)
 ]

 # or use individual levels for warn and crit
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.temperature", 'Switch Fabric Module 35', (40, 50)
 ]

perfdata:
 one value per sensor is returned: The temperature in °C, together with warn and crit levels

inventory:
 Finds one item per module

[parameters]
warn(int): {WARN} state is triggered, if at least one temperature is higher than this.
crit(int): {CRIT} state is triggered, if at least one temperature is higher than this.

[configuration]
brocade_mlx_temperature_default_levels(int, int): The standard levels for {WARN}
    and {CRIT}. Defaults are (50, 60)
