The documentation suggests that check_mk --cleanup-autochecks is synonymous with check_mk -u but when I run check_mk --cleanup-autochecks it reports a usage error instead of performing the operation. When I run check_mk -u, it does not report the usage message.

Fixed this issue. No cleanup was performed with the long format parameter.
