Title: Replaced insecure auth.secret mechanism
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415797737
Class: security

We replaced a insecure mechanism of generating the auth.secret which
is used during construction of the authentication cookies when a user
logs into the Check_MK Web GUI to make the authentication cookie only
valid for an individual site or a group of sites connected in a
distributed setup.

What you have to know about:

When the first user accesses the Web GUI after the update to this version,
all currently valid auth cookies of all users will be invalidated. As a
result all users will need to login again.

In distributed setups you will also need to do a replication from the
master site (which generated a new secret) to all slave sites (which
generated another secret themselfs). The replication will synchronize
the new secret of the master to all slaves which should make the
transparent authentication between all sites work again.
