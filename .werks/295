Title: Fixed problem with new created tag groups with "/" in title
Level: 1

Class: fix

If you used <tt>/</tt> chars in the tag group titles before, the text before
the first <tt>/</tt> was moved from the title to the topic field. This was not
intended. This has been fixed now.

However, there is still some issue with this: If you have existing tag groups with
slashes in their title, the same problem will happen. Thist must be fixed by hand
for the moment.
