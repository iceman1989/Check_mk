Title: cmk --cleanup should remove obsolete files
Component: core

Class: feature

We need a cleanup function that removes all files belonging
to hosts that do not longer exist. Maybe we need to make
a distinction between hosts not monitored but contained
in all_hosts (due to only_hosts). We also could remove
the RRD files via an option.

We could do this automatically on each cmk -R, maybe
via an option in main.mk
