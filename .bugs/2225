Title: Host diagnostics partially broken
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-11-17 15:26:35
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

The host diagnostics in WATO only refreshes two of the five boxes. Always
the first and by random one of the others. By clicking on the arrows you
can force updates - however.

Fixed. Transid handling has been removed for the diag requests.
