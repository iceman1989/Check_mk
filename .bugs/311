Title: IPMI cache initialization race condition

there is a very nasty issue with the IPMI agent code - if we kill the initial build of the SDR
cache there will be no point in re-doing the scan and IPMI will be disabled forever.  The problem
is that many IPMI modules are not able to handle concurrent requests. If building the SDR cache
takes longer than 55+ seconds then there is a chance that a new check_mk_agent call happens via
inetd. This second call will cause an IPMI issue which will cause the SDR cache scan to fail.
From that time on, IPMI will be disabled / broken.

Very ugly issue, maybe xinetd can disable multiple runs of the same service (but this would
mean staleness issues will stop the agent forever)

Or we implement a caching feature similar to that of <<<ipmitool>>>.

I've implemented a lock with a timeout of 60 secs now. Still
need some host with freeipmi in order to test this.
