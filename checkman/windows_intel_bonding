agents: windows

distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check checks the current state of a Windows intel bonding interface.
 If the total bonding state of the interface is down, then the
 check gets critical. If at least one slave interface is down
 or not the expected slave is currently active, then the check
 gets WARN.

item:
 The name of the bonding interface, etc {Bond_10.4}.

examples:
 # On windows hosts the lowest numbered eth interface should be
 # the active one.
 check_parameters = [
    ( { "expect_active" : "lowest" }, [ 'windows'], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES )
 ]

inventory:
 One check per {active} bonding interface will be created.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): Currently two parameters are available in this dict:

 {"primary"}: The assumed primary interface. This is for agents that do
 not provide this information. In that case this is set automatically
 by the inventory to the currently active interface.

 {"expect_active"}: Which interface should be expected active. This is one
 of the following strings: {"primary"}: The interface set by the
 parameter {"primary"}, {"lowest"}: The interface sorting lowest
 alphabetically, {"ignore"}: Ignore which interace is active.
