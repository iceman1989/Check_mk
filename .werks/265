Title: mpre_include: run additional mrpe configs within user context
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1390568187
Class: feature

This version brings the new local check <tt>mrpe_include</tt> where you can
configure additional include files for mrpe and under which user context
the commands of these files are run. It allows non-root users to add additional
mrpe commands without modifying the <tt>mrpe.cfg</tt> file.
You can assign include files to users and define in which user context the commands
should be executed.

This check is configured with the configuration
file <tt>mrpe_include.cfg</tt>. In a default installation this file is located
within the Check_MK config directory under <tt>/etc/check_mk/mrpe_include.cfg</tt>.

The <tt>mrpe_include.cfg</tt> does not contain the new mrpe commands,
though a user name followed by a include path.
Here is an example:

F+:/etc/check_mk/mrpe_include.cfg
# Execute as user ab
ab /etc/check_mk/mrpe_ab_commands.cfg
# Execute as user lm
lm /etc/other/mrpe_lm.cfg
# Execute with no user context change
- /etc/mrpe_default.cfg
F-:

Each line consists of two parameters, the user followed by the include file.
Each command within the include file is executed as this user.
If you do not want to change the user context (default is root), you can set the user to <tt>-</tt>.
The included files have the same configuration syntax as the <tt>mrpe.cfg</tt>.
