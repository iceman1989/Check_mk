Setup of check_mk agent on HP-UX
--------------------------------

Note: This is written without access to a HP-UX server.
Please carefully review and test the changes.


: add an entry /etc/services for HP-UX so inetd will know which tcp port:
# to listen on. 
check_mk         6556/tcp        #check_mk nagios agent


: add check mk to inetd config :
# check_mk agent support for remote monitoring
# 
check_mk stream tcp6 nowait root /usr/local/nagios/check_mk_agent check_mk_agent


: inetd security
# HP-UX does -by default- not use standard TCPWrappers and has a configuration
# differnt from standard /etc/hosts.allow /etc/hosts.deny
#
# The config file is optional and called /var/adm/inetd.sec
# It has the following syntax:
#
#    service name { allow | deny }
#           { hostaddrs | hostnames | netaddrs | netnames }
# 
# please note that in standard setups even very critical services like
# MC/SG are using inetd for their communications. You should test changes
# to the TCP security carefully.
# (We noticed inetd got hung by a misconfiguration, causing cluster warnings.
# After getting everything right, it worked without issues.

# to allow your nagios servers:

# only allow nagios servers to access the check_mk agent
check_mk	allow NAGIOS-SRV01 NAGIOS-SRV02

# reconfigure inetd to read in the changes.
inetd -c


# to verify configuration and / or check for issues, have a look at tcpdchk(1)
# http://nixdoc.net/man-pages/hp-ux/man1/tcpdchk.1.html 
# but this might only work if you installed tcpwrappers, which is not commonple.


# There's now a plugin for using libstatgrab like on Solaris/FreeBSD
