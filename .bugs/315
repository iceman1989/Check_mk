Title: embedded PNP-graphs broken if none are there
Component: multisite
State: done

If you got to the service details of a service without performance
data, then the embedded PNP-Graph area is not empty but shows
seven broken images.

2011-08-21 15:06:22: changed state open -> done
We show the fall back images only in case of a 404 respone
from the webserver (meaning that the JSON webserver is not
available).
