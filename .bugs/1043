Title: active check check_dns by default asks the wrong DNS server
Component: checks
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.3i2

if I add a check_dns active check to a server by a wato rule without any additional
parameters, I expect it to check the DNS server on *this* machine
but at the moment it does NOT: instead the resolver of the nagios machine is used
to determine which DNS server to send the name query to

the change would be the following:
as long as -s is not entered separately in the rule, the -s parameter should be
set to $HOSTADDRESS$
