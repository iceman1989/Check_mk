If for some reason you have very large history logfiles with millions of
entries then Livestatus would consume large amounts of memory while parsing
these when you access the <tt>log</tt> table. This could lead to a hanging
system or even a crash.

In order to avoid such situations the number of lines that are read from each
individual file are now limited. The default limit is one million lines. You
can change this default by defining the variable <tt>max_lines_per_logfile</tt>
in your <tt>nagios.cfg</tt>. The following example sets the maximum number
to 20 million lines:

F+:
broker_module=/some/path/livestatus.o max_lines_per_logfile=20000000 ...
F-:

When using the Check_MK Micro Core the configuration can be done
via WATO global setting <i>Maximum number of parsed lines per log file</i>.
