title: Various Linux kernel counters
agents: linux
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors various counters as found in {/proc/stat}
 and {/proc/vmstat}. Examples for those counters are {ctxt}
 (the number of process context switches per second), {pgmajfault}
 (the number of major page faults per second) and {processes}
 (the number of process creations per second).

 You can set a critical and warning level on each of those
 counters or just monitor them without levels in order to
 collect performance data. Levels you set to {None} will not
 be checked.

item:
 {"Context Switches"}, {"Process Creations"}, {"Major Page Faults"} or the name
 of the kernel counter in question as found in {/proc/stat} or
 {/proc/vmstat}.

examples:
 # Monitor major page faults, set levels to 200 and 400 per second
 # Do this on all hosts with the tag "lnx"
 checks += [
   ( ["lnx"], ALL_HOSTS, "kernel", "Major Page Faults", (200, 400) )
 ]

perfdata:
 One variable: the current value of the counter.

inventory:
 Per default one check for {"Major Page Faults"},
 {"Context Switches"} and {"Process Creations"}
 will be created on each host providing that data. You can
 override this list globally by setting {inventory_kernel_counters}
 to a list of strings with those counters that should be inventorized.
 Use {ignored_services} if you need a host-specific configuration
 of the inventory.

examples:
  # Make inventory create only checks for pgmajfault
  inventory_kernel_counters = [ "pgmajfault", "pgpgin", "pgpgout" ]

[parameters]
warning (int): The rate per second which triggers a warning. A value of {None} disables the level.

critical (int): The rate per second which triggers a critical state. A value of {None} disables the level.

[configuration]
inventory_kernel_counters (list of strings): List of performance counters the inventory should create checks for. Default is {[ "pgmajfault", "ctxt", "processes" ]}.

kernel_default_levels (int, int): Default levels for newly inventorized checks. Default is {(None, None)}, which disables the levels and makes the check always OK.
