Hostnames are now sorted naturally. That means that sequences of numbers
are being interpreted as numbers. This also works for host names that
have the form of an IPv4 address, e.g. <tt>10.1.1.5</tt> is now correctly
sorted before <tt>10.1.1.11</tt> and <tt>srv17_3</tt> comes before <tt>src17_108</tt>.
This new sorting is implemented in the status GUI and also in WATO.
