Title: check_mk_agent.linux: fix output of lnx_if on Ubuntu 8.04 (on older kernels), repairs tcp_conn_stats
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

Problem on some older kernels is, that <tt>/sys/class/net/$eth/address</tt> does
not contain a newline (or does not exist at all). We now always output an
additional newline. This does not harm and fixes the problem.

Without the fix the next section <tt>tcp_conn_stats</tt> is not correctly
detected and is missing.
