Currently it uses the mount point as variable name. This is nonsense and leads
to problems. In one case we even get too long filenames for the resulting RRDs
in MULTIPLE mode.

Resolution:

- Change to simple variable name
- Create some deprecated global option that simulates the old behaviour for some
  time.
