Title: Moved notify.log to var/log/notify.log in OMD environments
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417615456
Class: fix

The log was located in var/check_mk/notify.log but had no log rotation.
We moved it to var/log/notify.log now and added a log rotation. The
related configuration options have been changed to be enabled by default.
We also removed the option to totally disable this logfile because we'd
rather have some log information about eventual missing notifications
than no information at all.
