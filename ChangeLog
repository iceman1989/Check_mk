1.1.9i3:
    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
    * You need a current version of Livestatus for Multisite to work!
    * Multisite: removed (undocumented) view parameters show_buttons and show_controls.
      Please use display_options instead.
    * Finally removed deprecated filesystem_levels. Please use check_parameters instead.
    * Livestatus: The StatsGroupBy: header is still working but now deprecated.
      Please simply use Columns: instead. If your query contains at least one Stats:-
      header than Columns: has the meaning of the old StatsGroupBy: header

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Create alias 'cmk' for check_mk in bin/ (easier typing)
    * Create alias 'mkp' for check_mk -P in bin/ (easier typing) 

    Multisite:
    * Each column can now have a tooltip showing another painter (e.g.
      show the IP address of a host when hovering over its name)
    * Finally show host/services icons from the nagios value "icon_image".
      Put your icon files in /usr/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons.
      OMD users put the icons into ~/local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons.
    * New automatic PNP-link icons: These icons automatically appear, if
      the new livestatus is configured correctly (see below). 
    * new view property "hidebutton": allow to hide context button to a view.
    * Defaults views 'Services: OK', 'Services: WARN, etc. do now not create
      context buttons (cleans up button bar).
    * new HTML parameter display_options, which allows to switch off several
      parts of the output (e.g. the HTML header, external links, etc).
    * View hoststatus: show PNP graph of host (usually ping stats)
    * new tab "Display": here the user can choose time stamp
      display format and PNP graph ranges
    * new column "host_tags", showing the Check_MK host tags of a host
    * new datasource "alert_stats" for computing alert statistics
    * new view "Alert Statistics" showing alert statistics for all hosts
      and services
    * Sidebar: Fixed snapin movement to the bottom of the snapin list in Opera
    * Sidebar: Fixed scroll position saving in Opera
    * Fixed reloading button animation in Chrome/IE (Changed request to async mode)
    * Sidebar: Removed scrollbars of in older IE versions and IE8 with compat mode
    * Sidebar: Fixed scrolling problem in IE8 with compat mode (or maybe older IE versions)
      which broke the snapin titles and also the tactical overview table
    * Sidebar: Fixed bulletlist positioning
    * Sidebar: The sidebar quicksearch snapin is case insensitive again
    * Fixed header displaying on views when the edit button is not shown to the user
    * View pages are not refreshed when at least one form (Filter, Commands,
      Display Options) is open
    * Catching javascript errors when pages from other domain are opened in content frame
    * Columns in view editor can now be added/removed/moved easily

    Checks & Agents:
    * Fixed problem with OnlyFrom: in Linux agent (df didn't work properly)
    * cups_queues: fixed plugin error due to invalid import of datetime,
      converted other checks from 'from datetime import...' to 'import datetime'.
    * printer_supply: handle the case where the current value is missing
    * megaraid_ldisks: Fixed item detection to be compatible with different versions of megaraid
    * Linux Agent: Added new 3ware agent code to support multiple controllers
      (Re-inventory of 3ware checks needed due to changed check item names)

    Livestatus:
    * new column pnpgraph_present in table host and service. In order for this
      column to work you need to specify the base directory of the PNP graphs
      with the module option pnp_path=, e.g. pnp_path=/omd/sites/wato/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata
    * Allow more than one column for StatsGroupBy:
    * Do not use function is_contact_member_of_contactgroup anymore (get compatible
      with Nagios CVS)
    * Livestatus: log timeperiod transitions (active <-> inactive) into Nagios
      log file. This will enable us to create availability reports more simple
      in future.

    Multisite:
    * allow include('somefile.mk') in multisite.mk: Include other files.
      Paths not beginning with '/' are interpreted relative to the directory
      of multisite.mk

    Livestatus:
    * new columns services_with_info: similar to services_with_state but with
      the plugin output appended as additional tuple element. This tuple may
      grow in future so do not depend on its length!

1.1.9i2:
    Checks & Agents:
    * ibm_imm_health: fix inventory function
    * if/if64: fix average line in PNP-template, fix display of speed for 20MBit
      lines (e.g. Frame Relay)

    Multisite:
    * WATO: Fixed omd mode/site detection and help for /etc/sudoers
    * WATO: Use and show common log for pending changes 
    * Sidebar Quicksearch: Now really disabling browser built-in completion
      dropdown selections
    
1.1.9i1:
    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
    * TCP / SNMP: hosts using TCP and SNMP now must use the tags 'tcp'
      and 'snmp'. Hosts with the tag 'ping' will not inventorize any
      service. New configuration variable tcp_hosts.
    * Inventory: The call syntax for inventory has been simplified. Just
      call check_mk -I HOSTNAME now. Omit the "tcp" or "snmp". If you
      want to do inventory just for certain check types, type "check_mk --checks=snmp_info,if -I hostnames..."
      instead
    * perfdata_format now defaults to "pnp". Previous default was "standard".
      You might have to change that in main.mk if you are not using PNP (only
      relevant for MRPE checks)
    * inventory_check_severity defaults to 1 now (WARNING)
    * aggregation_output_format now defaults to "multiline"
    * Removed non_bulkwalk_hosts. You can use bulkwalk_hosts with NEGATE
      instead (see docu)
    * snmp_communites is now initialized with [], not with {}. It cannot
      be a dict any longer.
    * bulkwalk_hosts is now initizlized with []. You can do += here just
      as with all other rule variables.
    * Configuration check (-X) is now always done. It is now impossible to
      call any Check_MK action with an invalid configuration. This saves
      you against mistyped variables.
    * Check kernel: converted performance data from counters to rates. This
      fixes RRD problems (spikes) on reboots and also allows better access 
      to the peformance data for the Perf-O-Meters.  Also changed service 
      descriptions. You need to reinventurize the kernel checks. Your old
      RRDs will not be deleted, new ones will be created.
    * Multisite: parameters nagios_url, nagios_cgi_url and pnp_url are now
      obsolete. Instead the new parameter url_prefix is used (which must
      end with a /).

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Improve error handling: if hosts are monitored with SNMP *and* TCP,
      then after an error with one of those two agents checks from the
      other haven't been executed. This is fixed now. Inventory check
      is still not complete in that error condition.
    * Packages (MKP): Allow to create and install packages within OMD!
      Files are installed below ~/local/share/check_mk. No root permissions
      are neccessary
    * Inventory: Better error handling on invalid inventory result of checks
    * setup.sh: fix problem with missing package_info (only appears if setup
      is called from another directory)
    * ALL_SERVICES: Instead of [ "" ] you can now write ALL_SERVICES
    * debug_log: also output Check_MK version, check item and check parameters
    * Make sure, host has no duplicate service - this is possible e.g. by
      monitoring via agent and snmp in parallel. duplicate services will
      make Nagios reject the configuration.
    * --snmpwalk: do not translate anymore, use numbers. All checks work
      with numbers now anyway.
    * check_mk -I snmp will now try all checktypes not having an snmp scan
      function. That way all possible checks should be inventorized.
    * new variable ignored_checks: Similar to ignored_checktypes, but allows
      per-host configuration
    * allow check implementations to use common include files. See if/if64
      for an example
    * Better handling for removed checks: Removed exceptions in check_mk calls
      when some configured checks have been removed/renamed

    Checks & Agents:
    * Renamed check functions of imm_health check from test_imm to imm_health
      to have valid function and check names. Please remove remove from
      inventory and re-inventory those checks.
    * fc_brocade_port_detailed: allow to specify port state combinations not 
      to be critical
    * megaraid_pdisks: Using the real enclosure number as check item now
    * if/if64: allow to configure averaging of traffic over time (e.g. 15 min) 
      and apply traffic levels and averaged values. Also allow to specify relative
      traffic levels. Allow new parameter configuration via dictionary. Also
      allow to monitor unused ports and/or to ignore link status.
    * if/if64: Added expected interface speed to warning output
    * if/if64: Allow to ignore speed setting (set target speed to None)
    * wut_webtherm: handle more variants of WuT Webtherms (thanks to Lefty)
    * cisco_fan: Does not inventorize 'notPresent' sensors anymore. Improved output
    * cisco_power: Not using power source as threshold anymore. Improved output
    * cisco_fan: Does not inventorize 'notPresent' sensors anymore. Improved output
    * cisco_power: Not using power source as threshold anymore. Improved output
    * cisco_power: Excluding 'notPresent' devices from inventory now
    * cisco_temp_perf: Do not crash if device does not send current temperature
    * tcp_conn_stats: new check for monitoring number of current TCP connections
    * blade_*: Added snmp scan functions for better automatic inventory
    * blade_bays: Also inventorizes standby blades and has a little more
                  verbose output.
    * blade_blowers: Can handle responses without rpm values now. Improved output
    * blade_health: More detailed output on problems
    * blade_blades: Added new check for checking the health-, present- and
                    power-state of IBM Bladecenter blades
    * win_dhcp_pools: Several cleanups in check
    * Windows agent: allow restriction to ip addresses with only_hosts (like xinetd)
    * heartbeat_rscstatus: Catching empty output from agent correctly
    * tcp_conn_stats: Fixed inventory function when no conn stats can be inventoried
    * heartbeat_nodes: fix Linux agent for hostname with upper case letters (thanks to
            Thorsten Robers)
    * heartbeat_rscstatus: Catching empty output from agent correctly
    * heartbeat_rscstatus: Allowing a list as expected state to expect multiple OK states
    * win_dhcp_pools agent plugin: Filtering additional error message on
      systems without dhcp server
    * j4p_performance: Added experimental agent plugin fetching data via 
      jmx4perl agent (does not need jmx4perl on Nagios)
    * j4p_performance.mem: added new experimental check for memory usage via JMX.
    * if/if64: added Perf-O-Meter for Multisite
    * sylo: fix performance data: on first execution (counter wrap) the check did
      output only one value instead of three. That lead to an invalid RRD.
    * Cleaned up several checks to meet the variable naming conventions
    * drbd: Handling unconfigured drbd devices correctly. These devices are
      ignored during nventory
    * printer_supply: In case of OKI c5900 devices the name of the supply units ins not
      unique. The color of the supply unit is reported in a dedicated OID and added to the
      check item name to have a unique name now.
    * printer_supply: Added simple pnp template to have better graph formating for the check results
    * check_mk.only_from: new check for monitoring the IP address access restriction of the
      agent. The current Linux and Windows agents provide this information.
    * snmp_info check: Recoded not to use snmp_info_single anymore
    * Linux Agent: Fixed <<<cpu>>> output on SPARC machines with openSUSE
    * df_netapp/df_netapp32: Made check inventory resistant against empty size values
    * df_netapp32: Added better detection for possible 32bit counter wrap
    * fc_brocade_port_detailed: Made check handle phystate "noSystemControlAccessToSlot" (10)
      The check also handles unknown states better now
    * printer_supply: Added new parameter "printer_supply_some_remaining_status" to
      configure the reported state on small remaining capacity.
    * Windows agent: .vbs scripts in agents plugins/ directory are executed
      automatically with "cscript.exe /Nologo" to prevent wrong file handlers
    * aironet_clients: Only counting clients which don't have empty values for strength
    * statgrab_disk: Fixed byte calculation in plugin output
    * statgrab_disk: Added inventory function
    * 3ware_disks: Ignoring devices in state NOT-PRESENT during inventory

    Multisite:
    * The custom open/close states of custom links are now stored for each
      user
    * Setting doctype in sidebar frame now
    * Fixed invalid sidebar css height/width definition
    * Fixed repositioning the sidebar scroll state after refreshing the page
    * Fixed mousewheel scrolling in opera/chrome
    * Fixed resize bug on refresh in chrome
    * New view for all services of a site
    * Sidebar snapin site_status: make link target configurable
    * Multisite view "Recently changed services": sort newest first
    * Added options show_header and show_controls to remove the page headers
      from views
    * Cool: new button for an immediate reschedule of a host or service
      check: the view is redisplayed exactly at the point of time when
      Nagios has finished the check. This makes use of MK Livestatus'
      unique waiting feature.

   Livestatus:
    * Added no_more_notifications and check_flapping_recovery_notification
      fields to host table and no_more_notifications field to service table.
      Thanks to Matthew Kent

1.1.8:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * setup.sh: turn off Python debugging
    * Cleaned up documentation directory
    * cluster host: use real IP address for host check if cluster has
      one (e.g. service IP address)

    Checks & Agents:
    * Added missing PNP template for check_mk-hr_cpu
    * hr_fs: inventory now ignores filesystem with size 0,
      check does not longer crash on filesystems with size 0
    * logwatch: Fixed typo in 'too many unacknowledged logs' error message
    * ps: fix bug: inventory with fixed user name now correctly puts
      that user name into the resulting check - not None.
    * ps: inventory with GRAB_USER: service description may contain
      %u. That will be replaced with the user name and thus makes the
      service description unique.

    * hp_proliant_psu: Fixed multiple PSU detection on one system (Thanks to Andreas Döhler)
    * megaraid_pdisks: Fixed coding error

    Livestatus:
    * Prohibit { and } in regular expressions. This avoids a segmentation
      fault caused by regcomp in glibc for certain (very unusual) regular
      expressions.
    * Table status: new columns external_command_buffer_slots,
      external_command_buffer_usage and external_command_buffer_max
      (this was implemented according to an idea and special request of
       Heinz Fiebig. Please sue him if this breaks anything for you. I was
       against it, but he thinks that it is absolutely neccessary to have
       this in version 1.1.8...)
    * Table status: new columns external_commands and external_commands_rate
      (also due to Mr. Fiebig - he would have quit our workshop otherwise...)
    * Table downtimes/comments: new column is_service

    Multisite:
    * Snapin Performance: show external command per second and usage and
      size of external command buffer

    * Fix links for items containing + (e.g. service descriptionen including
      spaces)
    * Allow non-ASCII character in downtimes and comments
    * Added nagvis_base_url to multisite.mk example configuration
    * Filter for host/service groups: use name instead of alias if 
      user has no permissions for groups

1.1.8b3:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Added some Livestatus LQL examples to documentation
    * Removed cleanup_autochecks.py. Please use check_mk -u now.
    * RRA configuration for PNP: install in separate directory and do not
      use per default, since they use an undocumented feature of PNP.

    * postfix_mailq: Changed limit last 6 lines which includes all needed
		information
    * hp_proliant_temp/hp_proliant_fans: Fixed wrong variable name

    * Improve error output for invalid checks
    
    Checks & Agents:
    * fix bug: run local and plugins also when spaces are in path name
      (such as C:\Program Files\Check_MK\plugins

      direction (thanks Daniel Nauck for his precise investigation)

    Checks & Agents:
    * New check imm_health by Michael Nieporte
    * rsa_health: fix bug: detection of WARNING state didn't work (was UNKNOWN
            instead)
    * check_mk_agent.solaris: statgrab now excludes filesystems. This avoids hanging
      in case of an NFS problem. Thanks to Divan Santana.
    * multipath: Handle new output of multipath -l (found on SLES11 SP1)
    * ntp: fix typo in variable ntp_inventory_mode (fixes inventory problem)
    * if64: improve output formatting of link speed

      (must be UTF 8 encoded!)
    * improve compatibility with Python 2.3
    * Allow loading custom style sheet overriding Check_MK styles by setting
      custom_style_sheet in multisite.mk
    * Host icons show link to detail host, on summary hosts.
    * Fix sidebar problem: Master Control did not display data correctly

      services
    * Remove links to legacy Nagios GUI (can be added by user if needed)
    * Sidebar Quicksearch: fix several annoyances
    * Views with services of one host: add title with host name and status

      header (found by Sven Nierlein)
    * fix invalid json output for empty responses (found by Sven Nierlein)
    * fix Stats: avg ___ for 0 matching elements. Output was '-nan' and is
      now '0.0'
    * fix output of floating point numbers: always use exponent and make
      sure a decimal point is contained (this makes JSON/Python detect
      the correct type)

1.1.7i5:
    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * SNMP: do not load any MIB files (speeds up snmpwalk a lot!)
    * legacy_checks: new config variable allowing creating classical
      non-Check_MK checks while using host tags and config options
    * check_mk_objects.cfg: beautify output, use tabs instead of spaces
    * check_mk -II: delete only specified checktypes, allow to reinventorize

      instead of restarting it.
    * SNMP: Fixed string detection in --snmpwalk calls
    * SNMP: --snmpwalk does walk the enterprises tree correctly now
    * SNMP: Fixed missing OID detection in SNMP check processing. There was a problem
      when the first column had OID gaps in the middle. This affected e.g. the cisco_locif check.
    * install_nagios.sh: correctly detect Ubuntu 10.04.1
    * Config output: make order of service deterministic
    * fix problem with missing default hostgroup

    Multisite:
    * Sidebar: Improved the quicksearch snapin. It can search for services, 
      servicegroups and hostgroups now. Simply add a prefix "s:", "sg:" or "hg:"
      to search for other objects than hosts.
    * View editor: fix bug which made it impossible to add more than 10 columns
    * Service details: for Check_MK checks show description from check manual in
      service details
    * Notes: new column 'Custom notes' which allows customizable notes
      on a per host / per service base (see online docu for details)
    * Configuration: new variable show_livestatus_errors which can be set
      to False in order to hide error about unreachable sites
    * hiding views: new configuration variables hidden_views and visible_views
    * View "Service problems": hide problems of down or unreachable hosts. This
      makes the view consistant with "Tactical Overview"

    Checks & Agents:
    * Two new checks: akcp_sensor_humidity and akcp_sensor_temp (Thanks to Michael Nieporte)
    * PNP-template for kernel: show average of displayed range

    * if64/if: Improved PNP-Templates
    * if64/if: The ifoperstatus check in if64/if can now check for multiple target states
    * if64/if: Removing all null bytes during hex string parsing (These signs Confuse nagios pipe)
    * Fixed hr_mem and hr_fs checks to work with new SNMP format
    * ups_*: Inventory works now on Riello UPS systems
    * ups_power: Working arround wrong implemented RFC in some Riello UPS systems (Fixing negative power
      consumption values)
    * FreeBSD Agent: Added sections: df mount mem netctr ipmitool (Thanks to Florian Heigl)
    * AIX: exclude NFS and CIFS from df (thanks to Jörg Linge)

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Fix extra_nagios_conf: did not work in 1.1.7i2
    * Service Check_MK now displays overall processing time including
      agent communication and adds this as performance data
    * Fix bug: define_contactgroups was always assumed True. That led to duplicate
      definitions in case of manual definitions in Nagios 

    Checks & Agents:
    * New Check: hp_proliant_da_phydrv for monitoring the state of physical disks
      in HP Proliant Servers

      define them manually in Nagios.
    * host_notification_period has been removed. Use host_extra_conf["notification_period"]
      instead. Same holds for service_notification_periods, summary_host_notification_periods
      and summary_service_notification_periods.
    * Removed modes -H and -S for creating config data. This now does
      the new option -N. Please set generate_hostconf = False if you
      want only services to be defined.

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * New config option usewalk_hosts, triggers --usewalk during
      normal checking for selected hosts.
    * new option --scan-parents for automatically finding and 
      configuring parent hosts (see online docu for details)
    * inventory check: put detailed list of unchecked items into long
      plugin output (to be seen in status details)
    * New configuration variable check_parameters, that allows to

    Livestatus:
    * Fix problems with in_*_period. Introduce global
      timeperiod cache. This also improves performance
    * Table timeperiods: new column 'in' which is 0/1 if/not the
      timeperiod is currently active

      NagVis
    * Packager: make sanity check prohibiting creating of package files
      in Check MK's directories
    * install_nagios.sh: Support Ubuntu 10.04 (Thanks to Ben)
      
    Checks & Agents:
    * New check ntp.time: Similar to 'ntp' but only honors the system peer

    * Tactical Overview: Fixed refresh timeout typo
      (Was 16 mins instead of 10 secs)

    Livestatus:
    * Assume strings are UTF-8 encoded in Nagios. Convert from latin-1 only
      on invalid UTF-8 sequences (thanks to Alexander Yegorov)

    Multisite:
    * Correctly display non-ascii characters (fixes exception with 'ascii codec')
      (Please also update Livestatus to 1.1.6rc3)

1.1.6rc2:
    Multisite:

    Core, Setup, etc.:
    * Included three patched from Jeff Dairiki dealing with compile flags
      and .gitignore removed from tarballs
    * Fix problem with clustered_services_of[]: services of one cluster
      appeared also on others
    * Packager: handle broken files in package dir
    * snmp handling: better error handling in cases where multiple tables
      are merged (e.g. fc_brocade_port_detailed)
    * snmp: new handling of unprintable strings: hex dumps are converted
      into binary strings now. That way all strings can be displayed and
      no information is lost - nevertheless.
      
    Checks & Agents:
    * Solaris agent: fixed rare df problems on Solaris 10, fix problem with test -f
      (thanks to Ulf Hoffmann)
    * Converted all PNP templates to format of 0.6.X. Dropped compatibility
      with 0.4.X.
    * Do not use ipmi-sensors if /dev/ipmi0 is missing. ipmi-sensors tries

      started its event loop. This prevents showing services as PENDING 
      a short time during program start.

1.1.6b3:
    Multisite:
    * Quicksearch: hide complete host list if field is emptied via Backspace or Del.
      Also allow handle case where substring match is unique.

    * Get back to where you came after editing views
    * New sidebar snapin "Host Matrix"
    * New feature "status_host" for remote sites: Determine connection
      state to remote side by considering a certain host state. This
      avoids livestatus time outs to dead sites.

       packet and error statistics - PNP graphs included

     Multisite:
     * direct integration of PNP graphs into Multisite views
     * Host state filter: renamed HTML variables (collision with service state). You
       might need to update custom views using a filter on host states.
     * Tactical overview: exclude services of down hosts from problems, also exclude
       summary hosts
     * View host problems/service problems: exclude summary hosts, exclude services
       of down hosts

      * Linux: new check for filesystems mount options
      * Linux: new very detailed check for NTP synchronization
      * ifoperstatus: inventory honors device type, per default only Ethernet ports

      * kernel: now inventory is supported and finds pgmajfault, processes (per/s)
        and context switches
      * ipmi_sensors: Suppress performance data for fans (save much IO/space)
      * dual_lan_check: fix problem which using MRPE

      * Fix bug in PNP-template for Linux NICs (bytes and megabytes had been mixed up).
      * Windows agent: fix bug in output of performance counters (where sometimes with , instead of .)
      * Windows agent: outputs version if called with 'version'
      
      Core, Setup, etc.:
      * New SNMP scan feature: -I snmp scans all SNMP checks (currently only very few checks support this, though)
      * make non-bulkwalk a default. Please edit bulkwalk_hosts or non_bulkwalk_hosts to change that
      * Improve setup autodetection on RedHat/CentOS.  Also fix problem with Apache config for Mutliadmin: On RedHat Check_MK's Apache conf file must be loaded after mod_python and was thus renamed to zzz_check_mk.conf.
      * Fix problem in Agent-RPM: mark xinetd-configfile with %config -> avoid data loss on update
      * Support PNP4Nagios 0.6.2
      * New setup script "install_nagios.sh" for installing Nagios and everything else on SLES11
      * New option define_contactgroups: will automatically create contactgroup definitions for Nagios

1.1.0:
      * Fixed problems in Windows agent (could lead
        to crash of agent in case of unusal Eventlog
	messages)
      * Fixed problem sind 1.0.39: recompile waitmax for
        32 Bit (also running on 64)
      * Fixed bug in cluster checks: No cache files
        had been used. This can lead to missing logfile
	messages.
      * Check kernel: allow to set levels (e.g. on 
	pgmajfaults)
      * Check ps now allows to check for processes owned
        by a specific user (need update of Linux agent)
      * New configuration option aggregate_check_mk: If
        set to True, the summary hosts will show the
	status auf check_mk (default: False)
      * Check winperf.cpuusage now supports levels
        for warning and critical. Default levels are
	at 101 / 101
      * New check df_netapp32 which must be used
        for Netapps that do not support 64 bit 
	counters. Does the same as df_netapp
      * Symlink PNP templates: df_netapp32 and
        df_netapp use same template as df
      * Fix bug: ifoperstatus does not produce performance
        data but said so.
      * Fix bug in Multiadmin: Sorting according to
        service states did not work
      * Fix two bugs in df_netapp: use 64 bit counters
        (32 counter wrap at 2TB filesystems) and exclude
       	snapshot filesystems with size 0 from inventory.
      * Rudimentary support for monitoring ESX: monitor
        virtual filesystems with 'vdf' (using normal df
	check of check_mk) and monitor state of machines 
	with vcbVmName -s any (new check vmware_state).
      * Fixed bug in MRPE: check failed on empty performance
        data (e.g. from check_snmp: there is emptyness
        after the pipe symbol sometimes)
      * MK Livestatus is now multithreaded an can
        handle up to 10 parallel connections (might
        be configurable in a future version).
      * mk_logwatch -d now processes the complete logfile
        if logwatch.state is missing or not including the
	file (this is easier for testing)
      * Added missing float columns to Livestatus.
      * Livestatus: new header StatsGroupBy:
      * First version with "Check_MK Livestatus Module"!
        setup.sh will compile, install and activate
	Livestatus per default now. If you do not want
	this, please disable it by entering <tt>no</tt>,
	when asked by setup.
      * New Option --paths shows all installation, config
        and data paths of Check_mk and Nagios
      * New configuration variable define_hostgroups and
        define service_groups allow you to automatically
        create host- and service groups - even with aliases.
      * Multiadmin has new filter for 'active checks enabled'.
      * Multiadmin filter for check_command is now a drop down list.
      * Dummy commands output error message when passive services
        are actively checked (by accident)
      * New configuration option service_descriptions allows to
        define customized service descriptions for each check type
      * New configuration options extra_host_conf, extra_summary_host_conf
        and extra_service_conf allow to define arbitrary Nagios options
	in host and service defitions (notes, icon_image, custom variables,
        etc)
      * Fix bug: honor only_hosts also at option -C


1.0.39:
      * New configuration variable only_hosts allows
	you to limit check_mk to a subset of your
	hosts (for testing)
      * New configuration parameter mem_extended_perfdata
	sends more performance data on Linux (see 
	check manual for details)
      * many improvements of Multiadmin web pages: optionally 
	filter out services which are (not) currently in downtime
	(host or service itself), optionally (not) filter out summary
	hosts, show host status (down hosts), new action
	for removing all scheduled downtimes of a service.
	Search results will be refreshed every 90 seconds.
	Choose between two different sorting orders.
	Multadmin now also supports user authentication
      * New configuration option define_timeperiods, which
	allows to create Nagios timeperiod definitions.
	This also enables the Multiadmin tools to filter
	out services which are currently not in their
	notification interval.
      * NIC check for Linux (netctr.combined) now supports
	checking of error rates
      * fc_brocade_port: New possibility of monitoring
	CRC errors and C3 discards
      * Fixed bug: snmp_info_single was missing
        in precompiled host checks
	
1.0.38:
      * New: check_mk's multiadmin tool (Python based
	web page). It allows mass administration of
	services (enable/disable checks/notifications, 
	acknowledgements, downtimes). It does not need
	Nagios service- or host groups but works with
	a freeform search.
      * Remove duplicate <?php from the four new 
	PNP templates of 1.0.37.
      * Linux Agent: Kill hanging NFS with signal 9
	(signal 15 does not always help)
      * Some improvements in autodetection. Also make
	debug mode: ./autodetect.py: This helps to
	find problems in autodetection.
      * New configuration variables generate_hostconf and
	generate_dummy_commands, which allows to suppress
	generation of host definitions for Nagios, or 
	dummy commands, resp.
      * Now also SNMP based checks use cache files.
      * New major options --backup and --restore for
	intelligent backup and restore of configuration
	and runtime data
      * New variable simulation_mode allows you to dry
	run your Nagios with data from another installation.
      * Fixed inventory of Linux cpu.loads and cpu.threads
      * Fixed several examples in checks manpages
      * Fixed problems in install_nagios_on_lenny.sh
      * ./setup.sh now understands option --yes: This
        will not output anything except error messages
	and assumes 'yes' to all questions
      * Fix missing 'default.php' in templates for
	local
	
1.0.37:
      * IMPORTANT: Semantics of check "cpu.loads" has changed.
	Levels are now regarded as *per CPU*. That means, that
	if your warning level is at 4.0 on a 2 CPU machine, then 
	a level of 8.0 is applied.
      * On check_mk -v now also ouputs version of check_mk
      * logfile_patterns can now contain host specific entries.
	Please refer to updated online documentation for details.
      * Handling wrapping of performance counters. 32 and 64 bit
	counters should be autodetected and handled correctly.
	Counters wrapping over twice within one check cycle
	cannot be handled, though.
      * Fixed bug in diskstat: Throughput was computed twice
	too high, since /proc/diskstats counts in sectors (512 Bytes)
	not in KB
      * The new configuration variables bulkwalk_hosts and
	non_bulkwalk_hosts, that allow 	to specify, which hosts 
	support snmpbulkwalk (which is
	faster than snmpwalk) and which not. In previos versions,
	always bulk walk was used, but some devices do not support
	that.
      * New configuration variable non_aggregated_hosts allows
	to exclude hosts generally from service aggregation.
      * New SNMP based check for Rittal CMC TC 
	(ComputerMultiControl-TopConcept) Temperature sensors 
      * Fixed several problems in autodetection of setup
      * Fixed inventory check: exit code was always 0
	for newer Python versions.
      * Fixed optical problem in check manual pages with
	newer version of less.
      * New template check_mk-local.php that tries to
	find and include service name specific templates.
	If none is found, default.php will be used.
      * New PNP templates check_mk-kernel.php for major page
	faults, context switches and process creation
      * New PNP template for cpu.threads (Number of threads)
      * Check nfsmounts now detects stale NFS handles and
	triggers a warning state in that case

1.0.36:
      * New feature of Linux/UNIX Agent: "MRPE" allows
	you to call Nagios plugins by the agent. Please
	refer to online documentation for details.
      * Fix bug in logwatch.php: Logfiles names containing spaces
	now work.
      * Setup.sh now automatically creates cfg_dir if
	none found in nagios.cfg (which is the case for the
	default configuration of a self compiled Nagios)
      * Fix computation of CPU usage for VMS.
      * snmp_hosts now allows config-list syntax. If you do
	not define snmp_hosts at all, all hosts with tag
	'snmp' are considered to be SNMP hosts. That is 
	the new preferred way to do it. Please refer
	to the new online documentation.
      * snmp_communities now also allows config-list syntax
	and is compatible to datasource_programs. This allows
	to define different SNMP communities by making use
	of host tags.
      * Check ifoperstatus: Monitoring of unused ports is
	now controlled via ifoperstatus_monitor_unused.
      * Fix problem in Windows-Agent with cluster filesystems:
	temporarily non-present cluster-filesystems are ignored by
	the agent now.
      * Linux agent now supports /dev/cciss/d0d0... in section
	<<<diskstat>>>
      * host configuration for Nagios creates now a variable
	'name host_$HOSTNAME' for each host. This allows
	you to add custom Nagios settings to specific hosts
	in a quite general way.
      * hosts' parents can now be specified with the
	variable 'parents'. Please look at online documentation
	for details.
      * Summary hosts now automatically get their real host as a
	parent. This also holds for summary cluster hosts.
      * New option -X, --config-check that checks your configuration
	for invalid variables. You still can use your own temporary
	variables if you prefix them with an underscore.
	IMPORTANT: Please check your configuration files with
	this option. The check may become an implicit standard in
	future versions.
      * Fixed problem with inventory check on older Python 
	versions.
      * Updated install_nagios_on_lenny.sh to Nagios version
	3.2.0 and fixed several bugs.

1.0.35:
      * New option -R/--restart that does -S, -H and -C and
	also restarts Nagios, but before that does a Nagios
	config check. If that fails, everything is rolled
	back and Nagios keeps running with the old configuration.
      * PNP template for PING which combines RTA and LOSS into
	one graph.
      * Host check interval set to 1 in default templates.
      * New check for hanging NFS mounts (currently only
	on Linux)
      * Changed check_mk_templates.cfg for PING-only hosts:
	No performance data is processed for the PING-Check
	since the PING data is already processed via the
	host check (avoid duplicate RRDs)
      * Fix broken notes_url for logwatch: Value from setup.sh
	was ignored and always default value taken.
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_port to agent_port
	(please updated main.mk if you use that variable)
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_min_version to
	agent_min_version (update main.mk if used)
      * Renamed config variable mknagios_autochecksdir to 
	autochecksdir (update main.mk if used)
      * configuration directory for Linux/UNIX agents is
	now configurable (default is /etc/check_mk)
      * Add missing configuration variable to precompiled
	checks (fix problem when using clusters)
      * Improved multipath-check: Inventory now determines
	current number of paths. And check output is more
	verbose.
      * Mark config files as config files in RPM. RPM used
	to overwrite main.mk on update!
	
1.0.34:
      * Ship agents for AIX and SunOS/Solaris (beta versions).
      * setup script now autodetects paths and settings of your
	running Nagios
      * Debian package of check_mk itself is now natively build
	with paths matching the prepackaged Nagios on Debian 5.0
      * checks/df: Fix output of check: percentage shown in output
	did include reserved space for root where check logic did
	not. Also fix logic: account reserved space as used - not
	as avail.
      * checks/df: Exclude filesystems with size 0 from inventory.
      * Fix bug with host tags in clusters -> precompile did not
	work.
      * New feature "Inventory Check": Check for new services. Setting
	inventory_check_interval=120 in main.mk will check for new services
	every 2 hours on each host. Refer to online documentation
	for more details.
      * Fixed bug: When agent sends invalid information or check
	has bug, check_mk now handles this gracefully
      * Fixed bug in checks/diskstat and in Linux agent. Also
	IDE disks are found. The inventory does now work correctly
	if now disks are found.
      * Determine common group of Apache and Nagios at setup.
	Auto set new variable www_group which replaces logwatch_groupid.
	Fix bug: logwatch directories are now created with correct
	ownership when check_mk is called manually as root.
      * Default templates: notifications options for hosts and
	services now include also recovery, flapping and warning
	events.
      * Windows agent: changed computation of RAM and SWAP usage
	(now we assume that "totalPageFile" includes RAM *and*
	SWAP).
      * Fix problem with Nagios configuration files: remove
	characters Nagios considers as illegal from service
	descriptions.
      * Processing of performance data (check_icmp) for host
        checks and PING-only-services now set to 1 in default
	templates check_mk_templates.cfg.
      * New SNMP checks for querying FSC ServerView Agent: fsc_fans,
	fsc_temp and fsc_subsystems. Successfully tested with agents
	running	on Windows and Linux.
      * RPM packaged agent tested to be working on VMWare ESX 4.0 
	(simply install RPM package with rpm -i ... and open port 
	in firewall with "esxcfg-firewall -o 6556,tcp,in,check_mk")
      * Improve handling of cache files: inventory now uses cache
	files only if they are current and if the hosts are not
	explicitely specified.
	
1.0.33:
      * Made check_mk run on Python 2.3.4 (as used in CentOS 4.7
	und RedHat 4.7). 
      * New option -M that prints out manual pages of checks.
	Only a few check types are documented yet, but more will
	be following.
      * Package the empty directory /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
	and ../local into the RPM and DEB package of the agent
      * New feature: service_dependencies. check_mk lets you comfortably
	create Nagios servicedependency definitions for you and also
	supports them by executing the checks in an optimal order.
      * logwatch.php: New button for hiding the context messages.
	This is a global setting for all logfiles and its state is
	stored in a cookie.
	
1.0.32:
      * IMPORTANT: Configuration variable datasource_programs is now
        analogous to that of host_groups. That means: the order of
        program and hostlist must be swapped!
      * New option --fake-dns, useful for tests with non-existing
	hosts.
      * Massive speed improvement for -S, -H and -C
      * Fixed bug in inventory of clusters: Clustered services where
	silently dropped (since introduction of host tags). Fixed now.
      * Fixed minor bug in inventory: Suppress DNS lookup when using
	--no-tcp
      * Fixed bug in cluster handling: Missing function strip_tags()
	in check_mk_base.py was eliminated.
      * Changed semantics of host_groups, summary_host_groups,
	host_contactgroups, and summary_host_groups for clusters. 
	Now the cluster names will be relevant, not
	the names of the nodes. This allows the cluster hosts to
	have different host/contactgroups than the nodes. And it is more
	consistent with other parts of the configuration.
      * Fixed bug: datasource_programs on cluster nodes did not work
	when precompiling

1.0.31:
      * New option -D, --dump that dumps all configuration information
	about one, several or all hosts
	New config variables 'ignored_checktypes' and 'ignored_services',
        which allow to include certain checktypes in general or
        some services from some hosts from inventory
      * Config variable 'clustered_services' now has the same semantics
	as ignored_checktypes and allows to make it host dependent.
      * Allow magic tags PHYSICAL_HOSTS, CLUSTER_HOSTS and ALL_HOSTS at
	all places, where lists of hosts are expected (except checks).
	This fixes various problems that arise when using all_hosts at
	those places:
	  * all_hosts might by changed by another file in conf.d
	  * all_hosts does not contain the cluster hosts
      * Config file 'final.mk' is read after all other config files -
	if it exists. You can put debug code there that prints the
	contents of your variables.
      * Use colored output only, if stdout is a tty. If you have
	problems with colors, then you can pipe the output
	through cat or less
      * Fixed bug with host tags: didn't strip off tags when
	processing configuration lists (occurs when using
	custom host lists)
      * mk_logwatch is now aware of inodes of logfiles. This
	is important for fast rotating files: If the inode
	of a logfile changes between two checks mk_logwatch
	assumes that the complete content is new, even if
	the new file is longer than the old one.
      * check_mk makes sure that you do not have duplicate
	hosts in all_hosts or clusters.

1.0.30:
      * Windows agent now automatically monitors all existing
	event logs, not only "System" and "Application".

1.0.29:
      * Improved default Nagios configuration file:
	added some missing templates, enter correct URLs
	asked at setup time.
      * IMPORANT: If you do not use the new default 
	Nagios configuration file you need to rename
	the template for aggregated services (summary
	services) to check_mk_summarizes (old name
	was 'check_mk_passive-summary'). Aggregated
	services are *always* passive and do *never*
	have performance data.
      * Hopefully fixed CPU usage output on multi-CPU
	machines
      * Fixed Problem in Windows Agent: Eventlog monitoring
	does now also work, if first record has not number 1
	(relevant for larger/older eventlogs)
      * Fixed bug in administration.html: Filename for Nagios
	must be named check_mk.cfg and *not* main.mk. Nagios
	does not read files without the suffix .cfg. 
      * magic factor for df, that allows to automatgically 
        adapt levels for very big or very small filesystems.
      * new concept of host tags simplyfies configuration.
      * IMPORTANT: at all places in the configuration where
	lists of hosts are used those are not any longer
	interpreted as regular expressions. Hostnames
	must match exactly. Therefore the list [ "" ] does
	not any longer represent the list of all hosts.
	It is a bug now. Please write all_hosts instead
	of [ "" ]. The semantics for service expressions
	has not changed.
      * Fixed problem with logwatch.php: Begin with
	<?php, not with <?. This makes some older webservers
	happy.
      * Fixed problem in check ipmi: Handle corrupt output
	from agent
      * Cleaned up code, improved inline documentation
      * Fixed problem with vms_df: default_filesystem_levels,
	filesystem_levels and df magic number now are used
	for df, vms_df and df_netapp together. Works now also
	when precompiled.
	
1.0.28:
      * IMPORTANT: the config file has been renamed from
	check_mk.cfg to main.mk. This has been suggested
	by several of my customers in order to avoid 
	confusion with Nagios configuration files. In addition,
	all check_mk's configuration file have to end in
	'.mk'. This also holds for the autochecks. The 
	setup.sh script will automatically rename all relevant
	files. Users of RPM or DEB installations have to remove
	the files themselves - sorry.
      * Windows agent supports eventlogs. Current all Warning
        and Error messages from 'System' and 'Application' are
        being sent to check_mk. Events can be filtered on the
	Nagios host.
      * Fixed bug: direct RRD update didn't work. Should now.
      * Fixed permission problems when run as root.
      * Agent is expected to send its version in <<<check_mk>>>
	now (not any longer in <<<mknagios>>>
      * Fixed bug in Windows agent. Performance counters now output
	correct values
      * Change checks/winperf: Changed 'ops/sec' into MB/s.
	That measures read and write disk throughput
	(now warn/crit levels possible yet)
      * new SNMP check 'ifoperstatus' for checking link
        of network interfaces via SNMP standard MIB
      * translated setup script into english
      * fixed bug with missing directories in setup script
      * made setup script's output nicer, show version information
      * NEW: mk_logwatch - a new plugin for the linux/UNIX agent
	for watching logfiles
      * Better error handling with Nagios pipe
      * Better handling of global error: make check_mk return
	CRIT, when no data can retrieved at all.
      * Added missing template 'check_mk_pingonly' in sample
	Nagios config file (is needed for hosts without checks)
	
1.0.27:
      * Ship source code of windows agent
      * fix several typos
      * fix bug: option --list-hosts did not work
      * fix bug: precompile "-C" did not work because
	of missing extension .py
      * new option -U,--update: It combines -S, -H and
	-U and writes the Nagios configuration into a
	file (not to stdout).
      * ship templates for PNP4Nagios matching most check_mk-checks.
	Standard installation path is /usr/share/check_mk/pnp-templates
	
1.0.26:
      -	Changed License to GNU GPL Version 2
      * modules check_mk_admin and check_mk_base are both shipped
	uncompiled.
      * source code of windows agent togehter with Makefile shipped
	with normal distribution
      * checks/md now handles rare case where output of /proc/mdstat
	shows three lines per array

1.0.25:
      * setup skript remembers paths

1.0.24:
      * fixed bug with precompile: Version of Agent was always 0

1.0.23:
      * fixed bug: check_config_variables was missing in precompiled
	files
      * new logwatch agent in Python plus new logwatch-check that
	handles both the output from the old and the new agent

1.0.22:
      * Default timeout for TCP transfer increased from 3.0 to 60.0
      * Windows agent supports '<<<mem>>>' that is compatible with Linux
      * Windows agents performance counters output fixed
      * Windows agent can now be cross-compiled with mingw on Linux
      * New checktype winperf.cpuusage that retrieves the percentage
	of CPU usage from windows (still has to be tested on Multi-CPU
	machine)
      * Fixed bug: logwatch_dir and logwatch_groupid got lost when
	precompiling. 
      * arithmetic for CPU usage on VMS multi-CPU machines changed

1.0.21:
      * fixed bug in checks/df: filesystem levels did not work
	with precompiled checks

1.0.20:
      * new administration guide in doc/
      * fixed bug: option -v now works independent of order
      * fixed bug: in statgrab_net: variable was missing (affected -C)
      * fixed bug: added missing variables, imported re (affected -C)
      * check ipmi: new option ipmi_summarize: create only one check for all sensors
      * new pnp-template for ipmi summarized ambient temperature
 
1.0.19:
      * Monitoring of Windows Services
      * Fixed bug with check-specific default parameters
      * Monitoring of VMS (agent not included yet)
      * Retrieving of data via an external programm (e.g. SSH/RSH)
      * setup.sh does not overwrite check_mk.cfg but installs
	the new default file as check_mk.cfg-1.0.19
      * Put hosts into default hostgroup if none is configured
