Title: oracle_tablespaces: now able to bear None values as warn/crit levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1396946661
Class: fix

The levels in the oracle_tablespaces parameters could be set to None
if dynamic levels were used, but the filesystem was not within the limits
of the dynamic levels.
This caused an invalid check output.
