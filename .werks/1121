Title: Rule based notifications formular: No longer raises Request-Uri-Too-Large errors

If you wanted to create/edit a rule based notifcation and the formular itself had too much
configurable host tags, contact groups, etc. there was a problem on sending this formular to the server.
The data was sent with a GET request, which only allowed a limited url length.
This formular is now sent with a POST request.
