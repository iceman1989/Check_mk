Title: winperf_if: Improved matching of data from wmic_if.bat / wmic_if.ps1 scripts
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1410263307
Class: fix

Interfaces reported by the wmic_if.bat, wmic_if.ps1 script were not
entirely identical with the interface names reported by the windows
performance counters.
The matching algorhytm has been improved. Due to the better matching
the interface checks will provide more output, like the mac address.

Note: The new matching algorhythm should have no negative side effects for existing winperf_if checks
