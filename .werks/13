Title: Solaris Agent: implement cached async plugins and local checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385982276
Class: feature

The Solaris agent now supports the same method of asynchronously
executing local checks and plugins as the Linux agent. Simply
create directories below <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local</tt>
and <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins</tt> whose names are a
number of seconds (e.g. <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins/3600</tt>).
The plugins in those subdirectories will be executed at most every
that number of seconds and also will be run in the background.
