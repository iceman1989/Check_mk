  This check monitors the synchronsiation state of MySQL slave databases.

  This check needs the agent plugin {mk_mysql} to be installed on the
  monitored database server. Further details about this plugin and
  monitoring of MySQL can be found in the Check_MK online documentation
  in the article "Monitoring MySQL with Check_MK".

inventory:
  On each host where the agent plugin {mk_mysql} is being installed
  and the MySQL daemon is running one service is being generated.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): A dictionary with currentl just one possible key: {"seconds_behind_master"}. This
  is a pair if two floating point numbers:

  {warn} (float): The maximum number of seconds behind the master that triggers
    a {WARN} state.

  {crit} (float): The maximum number of seconds behind the master that triggers
    a {CRIT} state.

  If {seconds_behind_master} is not set, the check always reports {CRITICAL} states
  when either the slave IO or slave SQL are reported as not running.
