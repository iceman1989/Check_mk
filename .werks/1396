Title: Fix default setting of Enable sounds in views

Class: fix

The global settings in WATO displayed the default value for the setting
<i>Enable sounds in views</i> as <b>on</b>. If fact the default is
<b>off</b>. So as long as you did not switch this once back and forth no
sounds were being played. This has been fixed now and the default settings
is correctly being displayed as <b>off</b>.
