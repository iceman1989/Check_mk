Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.6b1

After the introduction of the necessary job owner, previous checks would fail
until reinventorized. This has been fixed. The check is now compatible with
old checks where the job owner is not yet contained in the item.
