Title: IE8: Hiliting of rows in checkbox mode is broken
Component: multisite
State: done
Class: bug
Date: 2011-10-27 18:51:44
Targetversion: 1.1.12

When in a view in Checkbox mode hovering over the rows
should hilite those rows. In IE8 this does not work.
The red background of the CRIT is destroyed, too.

Has just been fixed.
