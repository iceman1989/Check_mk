It confuses users that a manual restart via "cmk" command does not acknowledge the pending
changes which can be found in the wato changelog.

2012-05-25 11:31:44: changed state open -> wontfix
Esepcially in distributed wato setups this is not possible since cmk -R does not know anything about the
other sites. It would acknowledge the pending changes and remove the info that other sites don't have these
changes yet.
