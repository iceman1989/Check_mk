description:
 Checks the status of hosts an IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000 presents volumes
 to.

 If there are only hosts reporting status {active}, {online} or {inactive}
 the check returns {OK}. If there are hosts reporting {degraded} status or
 any unidentified status the check returns {WARN}. If some hosts report
 {offline} status the check returns {CRIT}.

 It is also possible to overwrite the return state with {OK} by passing {'always_ok' : True }
 as Parameter, or simply with the WATO Rule.
