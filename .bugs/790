Title: Three Livecheck issues
Component: livecheck
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-10-09 14:20:28
Targetversion: 1.2.0

1. In livecheck.c:53, int bytes_read = read(fd[0], output, sizeof(output));
does not guarantee a valid 0-byte terminated string. I propose a single
codeline after it: if (bytes_read > 0) output[bytes_read - 1] = 0; This
fixed an issue for me, where there was a lot of garbage behind output lines.

2. In livecheck.c:190, check_type should always be 0. check_type determines
wether it is active(0) or passive(1), not host/service. Since livecheck is
always run actively on the host that it puts the checkfile. This doesn't
have to be variable.

3. Somewhere before livecheck.c:188 the output charbuffer needs to be newline
escaped, there is a nagios function for this called escape_newlines. This
is necessary for long plugin output to be functional.
