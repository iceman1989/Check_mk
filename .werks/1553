Title: Fix deleting (acknowleding) of logfiles in logwatch

The button for deleting (i.e. acknowleding) logfile messages in the webpage
for the logwatch check did not work. This was due to a missing transaction ID,
which in turn was due to an internal code cleanup. This has been fixed now
and logfiles can now again be deleted.
