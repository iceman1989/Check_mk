title: Version of VirtualBox guest additions in Linux guests
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses {VBoxControl} to query to version und revision of the
 guest additions installed in a VirtualBox Linux guest. If no guest additions
 are installed at all, the check will get critical. if the version and
 revision of the guest additions do not match the version and revision
 of the virtual box host, the check will warn.

inventory:
 One check will be created on each Linux VBox host having guest
 additions installed(!). If you want to force the check on {all}
 of your Linux guests, you need to configure explicit checks using
 {checks=}.

examples:
 # Force this check on all hosts with the tags {vboxguest} and {linux}.
 checks += [
   ( ["vboxguest", "linux"], ALL_HOSTS, "vbox_guest", None, None ),
 ]
