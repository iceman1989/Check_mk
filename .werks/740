Title: winperf_if: now able to handle bandwidth > 4GBit
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i2
Date: 1396016199
Class: fix

If an interface had a bandwidth of > 4GBit the check did not receive
the correct bandwidth value, because of a 32 bit counter overflow.
Workaround: The windows plugin wmic_if.bat now also reports the correct bandwidth value.
If you use this plugin its bandwidth value will have precedence before the bandwidth determined by the agent.
