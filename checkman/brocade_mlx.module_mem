title: Brocade NetIron MLX devices: NI-MLX or BR-MLX Module Memory (RAM usage)
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/brocade
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 Checks the Module Memory (RAM usage) of a NI-MLX or BR-MLX module in Brocade
 NetIron MLX switching / routing devices.

 {WARN} or {CRIT} is returned, if the usage is above given thresholds.
 {OK} is returned otherwise.

item:
 If a module description is delivered by SNMP, the item is build from the
 module ID plus the description. Otherwise it is just the ID.

examples:
 # set default levels to 70 and 80 percent:
 brocade_mlx_mem_default_levels = { "levels": (70.0, 80.0) }

 # Check Module with ID 33 on a box called my-mlx-device with default levels
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.module_mem", '33 NI-MLX-32_MR Management', brocade_mlx_mem_default_levels),
 ]

 # or use individual levels for warn and crit
 checks += [
   ("my-mlx-device", "brocade_mlx.module_mem", '33 NI-MLX-32_MR Management', { "levels": (75.0, 85.0) }),
 ]

perfdata:
 one value is returned: The amount of memory used (in Bytes),
 together with warn and crit levels and maximum value

inventory:
 Finds one item per NI-MLX or BR-MLX module.
 Modules with state "empty" or "Blocked for full height card" are omitted.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): with the element
{"levels"}: (int or float, int or float): Levels of memory usage for {WARN} and {CRIT}.
  If a value is given as float, it is interpreted as percentage.
  If a value is given as int, it is interpreted as an absolute value in megabytes.

[configuration]
brocade_mlx_mem_default_levels(dict): The standard levels for {WARN} and
    {CRIT}, preset to { "levels": (80.0, 90.0) }
