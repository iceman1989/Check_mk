Title: Distributed WATO setup - error message during setting up slaves
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2012-10-26 08:38:47
Targetversion: 1.2.2

In current version, when setting up the local site and a slave site in the main site,
the main site reports that it is not the "preferred peer" while there is no peer setup.
Seems like the naming of the site is somewhat relevant here.

2013-01-11 12:29:43: changed state open -> works4me
Just tested - works
Creating a site setup:
  - add local site 
    Connection: connect to the local site
    URL Prefix: http://localhost/heute
  - add slave site
    Connection: unixsocket
    URL Prefix: http://localhost/sklave

    Set slave site replication method to "slave"

-> works like a charm
