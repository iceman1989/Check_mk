Title: BI nodes must not use the label of the aggregation for the node id
Component: bi
Class: bug
State: works4me

Targetversion: 1.2.0

At the moment the aggregation label is used for the html node id without any escaping or similar.
Labels like this "Host <a href=\"view.py?view_name=hoststatus&site=&host=$HOST$\">$HOST$</a>" will
destroy the bi page but should really be possible.

The label should not be used for HTML hacks. We'd rather invent
some general method of adding custom data into the BI tree view.
