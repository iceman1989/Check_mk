When clicking on the rotating arrows only the error 
message ERROR cannot reschedule check: time out
appears (after ~ 1 sec.)

LM: Works for me.

MK: Most time for me as well. But sometimes it
immediately fails....

I can not reproduce the problem. So I close this bug now. Please analyze+fix it next time it occurs.
