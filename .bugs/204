Title: BI does not detect infinite recursions correctly

At the moment BI does not catch direct loops (an object pointing to itselfs)
or indirect loops (some childs object points back to a parent object).

In the first case the python error message is OK but in the second case the
python error message is not very clear.

I've checked this and think the error message is pretty near to perfect.
