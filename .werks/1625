When you click an icon or button for creating a service specific rule in
WATO then characters, that have a special meaning in regular expressions,
are now correctly escaped with backslashes. These characters are: <tt>(</tt>,
<tt>)</tt>, <tt>.</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, <tt>$</tt>, <tt>[</tt>, <tt>]</tt>,
<tt>{</tt>, <tt>}</tt>, <tt>+</tt> and <tt>*</tt>
