Title: Virtual Host Tree: Allow to use topic as tree level

The <i>Virtual Host Tree</i> snapin now allows not only to use tag groups but also <b>topics</b>
as tree levels. A topic can only be used if:

<ul>
<li>It contains just <i>Checkbox</i>-tags (tags with only once choicee)</li>
<li>It contains at least two entries.</li>
</ul>

The idea is to make the typical <i>Applications</i> topic usable as a tree level. The
tree then shows all the different applications. Note: this usually leads to hosts being
contained in several branches of the tree (if they have several applications) and other
hosts not being contained at all (if the do not have at least one application).
