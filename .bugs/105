Title: SNMP scan: implement missing scan functions
Component: core
State: done
Class: cleanup
Date: 2011-01-24 16:22:26
Targetversion: 1.2.0

All SNMP checks must define scan functions. Otherwise the scan
can take a long time on some slow devices.

There is just one scan function missing:

$ doc/helpers/validate_checks  -a | grep scan
ibm_imm_health           snmp_scan manpage 

2011-12-29 09:25:41: changed state open -> done
Should work now.
