Title: notifications_enabled rules do generate integers / bools
Component: wato

Class: cleanup

The values are currently strings, "0" or "1". It would be much better
to have integers being generated.

Affects at least these rules:
extra_host_conf:flap_detection_enabled
extra_service_conf:flap_detection_enabled
extra_host_conf:notifications_enabled
extra_service_conf:notifications_enabled
