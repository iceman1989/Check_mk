Title: Moved filter logic to visuals module

This change is kind of an internal code restucturing. So if you do not
understand this, you mostly do not need to care about it.

The filter logic, which was former part of the views, has been moved
to the visuals module to be available to all visuals types like
dashboards in the future.

If you have defined custom filter plugins for your views, which are
normally located below share/check_mk/web/plugins/views/*.py, you need
to move the filter definitions to share/check_mk/web/plugins/visuals/*.py.
