Title: Checkboxes in views and brower back in disharmony
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2012-01-17 11:43:07
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Tested on IE8, but might be browser independent.
The following steps produce the problem:

1. Open a view and activate checkboxes
2. Check one service
3. Select "Downtime 2hours"
4. When the question "Are you sure?" comes press the
   browser "Back" button
   -> The one service is still being displayed as
   checks. Good. But internally it seems unchecked.
5. Now again select a command.
   -> Now the command will be applied to *all* 
   services instead of the one.

Maybe already fixed. Tested in Firefox, IE7-9
