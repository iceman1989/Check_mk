Title: md raid check reports wrong number of disks
Component: checks
State: closed
Class: bug

the infotext seems to mix up numbers
this is from a 4-disk raid10 with one "missing" member
CRIT - disk state is [4/3] [UUU_] (expected 3 disks to be up)
... there was 2 or 3 disks during inventory actually, since i created it with
"sda missing sdb missing". but the message sounds like the numbers are just 
twisted

Works for the moment. Maybe review this with additional information (agent outputs).
