Title: WATO context button on quicksearch result page broken
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2014-07-04 09:30:24
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

When searching for a host substring, for example "node", results in a page listing
all services of the hosts node1 and node2. When clicking on the context button
WATO, it displays a red error message that the host "node" (the substring) is not
managed by WATO.

2014-12-01 11:05:43: changed state open -> works4me
old bug, already fixed.
