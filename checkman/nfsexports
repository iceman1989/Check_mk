description:
 This check validates NFS exports on a NFS file server.
 It looks at exports defined both in /etc/exports (classic way) or exports
 that are run-time defined using exportfs by a cluster management software.
 It uses the native NFS toolset to query this information and should notice
 errors in the NFS server daemons or portmapper.

 If you want to use this check then you will have to install the appropriate
 agent plugin.

item:
 The name of the NFS export, which is the name of the exported filesystem.

perfdata:
  This check does not provide performance data.

inventory:
  All NFS exportss are found automatically. This is done
  using showmount -e (not /proc)
