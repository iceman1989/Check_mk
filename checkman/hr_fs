title: Used space in filesystems via SNMP
agents: snmp
catalog: os/storage
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the usage of filesystems using SNMP and
 the {HOST-RESOURCES-MIB}, which is supported by many SNMP
 agents - especially those on full operating systems.

 For configuration parameters and examples please refer to the man page
 of {df}.

 Please note, that due to the fact that Linux usually reserves 5% of
 the filesystem for root, the amount of used space output by this
 check and the native {df} check of Linux differs by up to 5%. The
 {df} check accounts the reserved space as used, as this is a safer
 assumption. Whereas the SNMP agent accounts it as free. There is no
 way to get the information about the reserved space via SNMP, so
 there is no way to fix this, unfortunately.

item:
 The description of the filesystem as in {hrStorageDescr}. For
 Linux SNMP agents this is the mount point.

inventory:
 For each fixed disk one service is generated - if the description
 of the filesystem in not listed in {inventory_df_exclude_mountpoints}.

perfdata:
 One or three values: The first value is the used space of the filesystem
 in MB. Also the minimum (0 MB), maximum (size of the filesystem) and the warning and critical
 levels in MB are provided. If {trend_range} is set (the default), then
 two additional values are output: the change of the usage in MB per range
 since the last check (e.g. in MB per 24 hours) and the averaged change (so called trend),
 also in MB per range.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check supports two types of parameters. The
 new version supports trends and is a dictionary with the following
 keys:

 {"levels"}: Warning and critical level of filesystem usage in percentages
 of the filesystem size. The default is {(80, 90)}.

 {"magic"}: The magic number, which scales the levels according to the
 filesystem size. Default
 is a factor of 1.0, which does no adaptation. A factor less than 1.0 raises
 the levels for large filesystems and lowers them for small ones. Please
 look at online documentation for more details about the magic factor.

 {"magic_norm"}: Norm size of a filesystem for the magic computation.
 The default for this is {20}. It is measured in {GB}.

 {"levels_low"}: When applying the magic factor the warn/crit levels
 will never drop below these numbers. The is preset to {(50,60)}.

 {"trend_range"}: The time range over that trends are computed. This
 is in hours and preset to {24} (i.e. one day). If you set this to
 {None} then trend computing is disabled and the check outputs only
 one performance data value.

 {"trend_mb"}: A pair of numbers specifying the maximum number of
 megabytes the usage is allowed to grow within the time range if not
 triggering warning/critical. If you set this to {(10,20)} then
 the check will warn if the size grows by more than 10 MB per {trend_range}
 hours and critical if it grows more than 20 MB. Per default no levels
 are applied.

 {"trend_perc"}: This is similar to trend_mb but here you specify
 the allowed growth in percentages of the filesystem size. Fractional
 values are allowed. This may be used in parallel with trend_mb.

 {"trend_timeleft"}: A pair of numbers that specifies the minimum
 hours of time left until the filesystem gets full. If you set this
 to {(48,24)} then the check will warn if the estimated time until
 the disk is full is 48 hours or less. It will get critical if only
 24 hours are assumed to be left.

 It is still possible to specify a pair or triple of numbers
 {instead} of a dictionary:

warning (int): The percentage of used space that triggers
 WARNING state
critical (int): The percentage of used space that triggers
 CRITICAL space
magic_factor (float): Optional: Magic factor that adapts the levels
 according to the size of the filesystem. Default
 is a factor of 1.0, which does no adaptation. A factor
 less than 1.0 raises the levels for large filesystems
 and lowers them for small ones. Please look at online
 documentation for more details about the magic factor.

[configuration]
filesystem_default_levels (dict, pair or triple): Default levels for filesystem detected by inventory. For further paramters please refer to the man page of {df}.
