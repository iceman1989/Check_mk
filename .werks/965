Title: Cumulative permissions and contact groups for WATO folders

WATO folders have now two new checkboxes in the <i>Permissions</i> attributes:

<ul>
<li><i>Give these groups also permission on all subfolders</i></li>
<li><i>Add these groups as contacts in all subfolders</i></li>
</ul>

The first one will add the configured groups of a folder also as permitted
groups to all subfolders (recursively). The second one will add the configured
groups as <b>contact groups</b> to the hosts in all subfolders.

The idea behind that is a simplification of the configuration. It is now
sufficient to specify the groups of you more general administrators at
the top of the folder tree and add more and more specific groups at
the lower levels of your folder tree.

In the table of hosts you now will see the permitted groups and the
contact groups of a host as two separate columns.
