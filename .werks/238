Title: vsphere monitoring: new option to skip placeholder vms in agent output
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

When using a Site Recovery Manager (SRM) some of the virtualmachines are only
used as fallback. The new agent_vsphere option -p allows to suppress any output
regarding placeholder vms.
Placeholder vms are identified by not having an assigned VirtualDisk Device.
The option is also configurable via the WATO rule "Check state of VMWare ESX via vSphere"
