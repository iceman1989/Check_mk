Title: New Mutisite filter for the number of services a host has
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1403860884
Class: feature

This filter is available for all views but currently added only in
the <i>Host search</i> view. It allows you to find hosts based on the
number of services they have. That way you can find e.g. hosts where
no service inventory has been done or your hosts that produce most
of your services.
