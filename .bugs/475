Title: lnx_if fails if ethtool is not working
Component: checks
State: done
Class: bug
Date: 2011-12-06 08:47:42
Targetversion: 1.1.12

The check should work, if information from ethtool is missing.
That way also virtual network cards (e.g. from VMWare) will
work. We must make shure, however, that we do not inventorize
lo, sit and other dummy devices.

2011-12-14 10:59:14: changed state open -> done
We assume a link state of up if information from ethtool 
is missing and the nic has been in use since the last
reboot.
