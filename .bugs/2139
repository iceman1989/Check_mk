Title: new oracle do inventorize wrong check "YOU HAVE NEW MAIL"
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: works4me

Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

When there are pending mails for the user which sqlplus.sh does perform
a su - to, the user gets a message "[YOU HAVE NEW MAIL]". This has been
seen on an AIX host.
This should be filtered somewhere.

3.12.2014: forwarded that to Thorsten Bruhns

2014-12-03 15:45:15: changed state open -> works4me
Thorsten thinks that this can only happen on an old version
of mk_oracle. Not with the new one.
