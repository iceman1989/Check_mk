Title: Introduce optional lower limit for predicted levels
Level: 1
Component: core

Class: feature

When configuring predictive levels while using relative levels or those
based on the standard deviation then time periods with a very low
reference (e.g. a CPU load below 1) would result in very narrow levels
and lead to frequent false alarms.

Now you can set a lower limit for the levels, for example such that they
would never go below 5 and 10 for warn and crit - regardless of the
current predicted value.
