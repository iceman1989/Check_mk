The tool livedump-mail-fetch which can be used to receive livedump results by fetching
them from a mailbox e.g. via POP3 always assumed incoming mails to be encoded as
quoted-printable.

This change makes the mail parsing configurable. The default is still quoted printable,
but can be set to "None" to assume plain text mails.
