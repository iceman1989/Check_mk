Title: livestatus table hostsbygroup: fixed bug with group_authorization strict
Level: 2
Component: livestatus
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1396445685
Class: fix

On calling the livestatus table hostsbygroup with an AuthUser the table
did not hide the entire hostsgroup in case the group_authorization was set to <tt>strict</tt>
and one host in the group was not a contact for the AuthUser.

This has been fixed.

With the group_authorization <tt>strict</tt> setting the AuthUser now
needs to be a contact of every host in the hostgroup, otherwise the hostgroup
is not shown at all.
