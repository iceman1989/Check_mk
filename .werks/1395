Title: Event Console can now create notifications via Check_MK RBN
Level: 2
Component: ec
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1409752217
Class: feature

The Event Console has now the new builtin action <i>Send monitoring
notification</i> that can be used in all three situations where actions
are possible:

<ul>
<li>When an event is being opened</li>
<li>When an event is being cancelled</li>
<li>By a user executing an action on an open event</li>
</ul>

This new action creates a monitoring notification just as the ones that happen,
when in normal (non-EC) monitoring a service goes from OK to CRIT or vice
versa. This notification is being process by the rule based notifications
and is handled just like a monitoring notification.

Why whould you want to do that?

<ul>
<li>You can use the same notification plugins for alarms triggered by the
monitoring and by the Event Console. No need for an extra SMS script in
the Event Console.</li>
<li>You can use all of the flexiblity of existing notification plugins - including
configuring their parameters via WATO.</li>
<li>All notifications from your Check_MK environment are now controlled by a common set of notification
rule. For example if a user wants to disable all of his notifications then there is just
one place for doing that.</li>
</ul>

There is nothing you need to setup. Just check the action <i>Send monitoring
notification</i> in your event rules and that's it.

<b>Note</b>: Because events are not exactly the same as services and because
of the nature of distributed monitoring there are a few specialities in
notifications that come from the Event Console:

<ul>
<li>EC notifications have only limited information about the host. There is
<b>no information</b> about host tags or WATO folders. Do not use matching
criteria on those or otherwise that match will always fail.</li>
<li>EC notifications currently have no information about contacts or groups of
a host. This would need an online Livestatus query, but that would fail
if the host is being monitored by a remote system.</li>
<li>EC notifications do not have a <i>previous</i> host or service state,
since the Event Console is a stateless monitoring.
Do not set any matching criteria on the event type since none of these
can be fullfilled currently.</li>
<li>All EC notifications are sent as <i>service</i> notifications. The name
of the event's application is taken as service description.</li>
</ul>

The notification rules have got a new matching option especially for EC
notifications: <i>Event Console alerts</i>. Here you can make a notification
rule deal only with EC notifications or exclude just those.  You can also match
on EC specific fields like the event's rule id, syslog priority, syslog
facility and event comment.

Most of the event's special fields are available as notification
context variables - to be used in custom notification scripts or
template definitions.  Please use the standard debugging methods
for displaying all variables.  At least defined are <tt>EC_ID</tt>,
<tt>EC_RULE_ID</tt>, <tt>EC_PRIORITY</tt>, <tt>EC_FACILITY</tt>,
<tt>EC_PHASE</tt>, <tt>EC_COMMENT</tt>, <tt>EC_OWNER</tt>, <tt>EC_PID</tt>,
<tt>EC_MATCH_GROUPS</tt>, and <tt>EC_CONTACT_GROUPS</tt>.
