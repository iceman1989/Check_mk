Title: Active checks: Non-ascii check commands now converted into utf-8
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i5

Class: fix

There were some instances where the arguments for an active check
did contain non-ASCII characters, for example python unicode.
This caused an exception during the configuration generation.<br>

Check commands for active checks are now always converted into utf-8.
