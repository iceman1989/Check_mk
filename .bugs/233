lnx_if should only rely on ethtool for ethernet interfaces
it seems to instead only detect ethernet interfaces because others wont support ethtool
examples: tunnel interfaces, wan stuff?, vlans? & infiniband

This is not the case. All interfaces are supported. You might have to
add if_inventory_portstates.append('4') for some interfaces. If there
is no ethtool output, then the operstate is set to 4 (unknown).
