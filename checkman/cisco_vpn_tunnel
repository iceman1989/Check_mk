description:
 This check tests for the existence of inventorized IPSEC and remote access VPN
 Tunnels on a Cisco ASA device. A name and a state if the configured tunnel can no longer
 be found can be configured. Also, a global state for no longer existing
 tunnels can be configured.
 The check has been tested with a cisco model ASA 5510.

inventory:
 One check is created for each IPSEC and remote access tunnel found during inventory

item:
 Check item is the ip address of the remote tunnel endpoint

examples:
 checkgroup_parameters.setdefault('vpn_tunnel', [])

 checkgroup_parameters['vpn_tunnel'] = [
   ( {'state': 1, 'tunnels': [('12.34.56.78', 'dark tunnel', 2)]}, [], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES ),
   ] + checkgroup_parameters['vpn_tunnel']


[parameters]
parameters(dict): with the keys "state" and "tunnel"

 'state' is the globally returned state of no longer existent tunnels

 'tunnels' is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of the ip address of the tunnel endpoint,
 a corresponding name of the tunnel shown in the check output, and the state which is returned
 when the tunnel no longer exists.
