Title: raritan_pdu_inlet, raritan_pdu_inlet_summary: Modified existing check to give one item per phase and support setting levels.
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417190388
Class: feature

raritan_pdu_inlet used to create one item per sensor. Now, only one item per phase is created.
A Perf-O-Meter displaying the power has been added, as well as a WATO rule to configure
warning and critical levels.
raritan_pdu_inlet_summary works very similarily, but provides summary information concerning all
phases.
