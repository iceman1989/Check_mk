Title: brocade_mlx: omit inventory of cpu and memory on more states
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1393336534
Class: fix

If for a module the status is "Blocked for full height card" it is omitted
during inventory for CPU and Memory checks, because there is no sense in
checking them.
