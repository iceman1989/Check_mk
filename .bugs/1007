Title: liveproxyd does not handle very slow and stalled connections well

In case of network problems in a distributed monitoring setup liveproxyd still has problems identifying
a slow connection with a lot of packet loss. It does not declare the connection as dead, and as a consequence
the load of the monitoring server can get very high, making it essentially unusable.
