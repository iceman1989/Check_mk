Title: mk_oracle: completely overhauled ORACLE monitoring
Level: 3
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415093156
Class: feature

Check_MK now comes with a completely overhauled ORACLE monitoring. The
new agent plugins <tt>mk_oracle</tt> and <tt>mk_oracle.aix</tt> are ready
for use. The previous version of the Linux agent plugin has moved to
<tt>doc/treasures/mk_oracle.old</tt>.

Note: You do not need to update your already deployed plugins to the
new version immediately. The check plugins are compatible with the
output of both the old and the new agent.

The new agent has several advantages:

<ul>
<li>It comes with many additional checks.</li>
<li>It now correctly supports all ORACLE versions starting from 9.2.</li>
<li>It supports authentication via the ORACLE password wallet.</li>
<li>It is much faster: it only needs two logins into each database -
one of which is being done only every 10 minutes.</li>
</ul>

We are preparing an update of the documentation as well.
