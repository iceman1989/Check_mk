title: IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000: Status and Usage of MDisksGrps
agents: ibm_svc

distribution: check_mk
description:
 Checks the status and usage of MDisksGrps in an IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000
 device.

 It uses the check logic of the {df} check, so for configuration parameters
 and examples please refer to the man page of {df}.

 Additionally the status of the MDisksGrp is checked. On every other status
 than {online} the check results in {CRIT} status.

 Please note: You need the Special Agent agent_ibmsvc to retrieve the monitoring
 data from the device. Your monitoring user must be able to SSH to the device
 with SSH Key Authentification. Please exchange SSH key. The Special Agent itself
 can be configured by WATO.

item:
 The name of the MDisksGrp

inventory:
 Creates one check for every MDiskGrp in th IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000
 device.

examples:
 # set levels for the MDiskGrp Quorum_1 to 90% for WARN and 95% for CRIT
 # for all hosts with the host tag ibmsvc
 checkgroup_parameters['filesystem'] = [
   ( {'levels': (90.0, 95.0)}, ['ibmsvc'], ALL_HOSTS, ['Quorum_1$'] ),
   ] + checkgroup_parameters['filesystem']

perfdata:
 Three values: The first value is the used space of in the MDiskGrp
 in MB. Also the minimum (0 MB), maximum (Capacity of the MDiskGrp)
 and the warning and critical levels in MB are provided.
 The second is the change of the usage in MB per range since the last check
 (e.g. in MB per 24 hours) and the 3rd is the averaged change (so called
 trend), also in MB per range. Please note, that performance data for
 trends is enabled per default. You can globally disable that in {main.mk}
 with {filesystem_default_levels["trend_perfdata"] = False}.
