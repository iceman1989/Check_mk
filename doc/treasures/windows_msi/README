BUILD MSI PACKAGE
=================

These scripts allow you to build an initial msi packages for the Check_MK windows agent.
The package contains both versions (32/64 bit) of the windows agent.
Upon installation the correct agent is automatically chosen and registered as service.
This msi packages is only build once. Afterwards its contents are exchanged by a different
mechanism (msibuild) found in the windows agent directory.

Requires
---------------------------------
- A wine environment with the program packages Mono and Wix-Toolset
  http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html
  http://wixtoolset.org/

- A working directory where the msi package is build, containing the files
  cmk_InstallDirDlg.wxs    # Modified Install Dialog with Install Service Checkbox
  cmk_WixUI_InstallDir.wxs # Modified Install Dialog with Install Service Checkbox
  check_mk_agent.wxs       # The msi package description
  built_msi.bat            # The batch script calling various commands to create the msi
  sourceFiles/check_mk_agent.exe    # 32 Bit binary
  sourceFiles/check_mk_agent-64.exe # 64 Bit binary
  sourceFiles/check_mk.example.ini  # example configuration
  sourceFiles/GPL-V2.rtf            # GPL-V2 license displayed within the installer

 The default path for this directory is C:/mkmsi.
 If you want to change this you need to update the file built_msi.bat
