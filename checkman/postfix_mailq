title: Length of the postfix mailqueue
agents: linux
catalog: app/postfix
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of {mailq} as sent by the linux agent of
 Check_MK. The command lists all mails which wait in the mail queue
 of postfix.
 The check analyzes the summary line at the bottom of the output.

 This check creates one service per host which represents the state
 of the servers mailqueue.

 The check will result in WARNING/CRITICAL states when the number of items
 in the queue reach the defined thresholds.

examples:
 # At 16 mails in the queue the check will result in a WARNING state
 # With 30 mails a CRITICAL state will be raised
 postfix_mailq_default_levels = (15, 30)

perfdata:
 Two variables: the number of messages in {length} and the {size} of the
 messages in the queue in bytes.

inventory:
 On each system which provides the {mailq} command one service is being created.

[parameters]
warning (int): Queues with more than this value will result in a WARNING state
critical (int): Number of messages in the queue to result in a CRITICAL stat

[configuration]
postfix_mailq_default_levels (int, int): The global default levels for all checks
 of this type. This is preset to {(10, 20)} (which means that the check
 gets critical if there are more than {20} messages in the queue).
