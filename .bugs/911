Title: Distributed WATO - activate changes not transid secured
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2013-02-04 10:06:34
Targetversion: 1.2.2

When one hits F5 during global activate changes, the table is re-rendered and all
sites do sync & restart again. This should be prevented by transids.
