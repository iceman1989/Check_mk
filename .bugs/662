Title: "Remove All" downtimes command button selection problem
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-10-26 10:55:14
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Set a downtime for multiple services within a view

Try to remove these downtimes with the "Remove all" button, but additionally select some services with no
downtime set -> Shows error "Sorry. This function is not implemented" 

Select exactly the services in downtime and press "Remove all" -> working

2013-01-04 09:42:59: changed state open -> done
Has been changed to work even if there was no downtime available to delete. The "success" message shows
up a note "no data row", means no downtime has been deleted. But this is no error message, since the 
result is as expected: No downtimes (anymore).
