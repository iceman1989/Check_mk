Title: Fixed wrong information showing up on "Host Group" and "Service Group" views
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Class: fix

The views with the names hostgroup and servicegroup which are linked from several pages
like the host group summary view when clicking on the name of a group showed hosts or
services multiple times instead of once. This has been fixed now.

If you used a link to access these views directly, you will need to re-create them,
because the names of the URL variables changed.
