Title: Generating selection id is hopefully now compatible to more systems
Level: 1

Class: fix

The default mechanism to get a selection id is to generate a UUID by reading
the contents of the file /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid. This might be not
existing on some special systems. So we use the uuid python module as
fallback now.
