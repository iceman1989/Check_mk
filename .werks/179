Class: feature

Befor this change, it was only possible to define the ip of a dns server or use the the ip address of the host as dns server. Now it's also possible to omit this confiuration. In this case the check is done against the local dns servers configured on the monitoring server.

This is usefull if you e.g. want check web domain names.
