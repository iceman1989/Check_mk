Title: Multisite context buttons: links in context buttons are no longer called twice
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: fix

The "onclick" attribute in the context button (buttons at the top of a page) additionally
called the href link, which was already specified in the "href" attribute.
This could lead to raise conditions where transactions (saving a formular) were not handled correctly.
