Levels for the electric power of ups devices are in watt, however the check uses the group
hw_temperature to set the values with the corresponding wato check in degrees celcius.
This will nevertheless work and may be in active use since the values are integers. However it 
may be confusing. A new group hw_power with corresponding wato rule should be added. Customers 
need to be aware that this fix may break their existing checks.
