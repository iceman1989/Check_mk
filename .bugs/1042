Title: Package should have dependency to apache2-prefork
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-08-30 15:48:55
Targetversion: 1.2.3i5

Problems in Multisite GUI if apache is running with mpm prefork works so the
package should depend on apache2-mpm but at least the deb for ubuntu 13.04
64bit does not, maybe others too

Here is the fix. Important for the future: when supporting a new distribution
we must not copy the file from omdistro.org, but create one ourselves, since
we have several changes in that file.
