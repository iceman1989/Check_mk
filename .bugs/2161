Title: Visual: single-context views with hardcoded context should not display filter
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-09-02 12:20:34
Targetversion: future

Currently the filter is being displayed, with an Warning icon, and any changes are silently
ignored.

The filter should not be visible in that case.

2014-12-02 10:04:25: changed state open -> done
The default seting can now be overriden.
