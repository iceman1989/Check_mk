description:
 This check monitors the state of all Multipath devices
 on an ESX host system.
 Without further configuration it returns {CRIT} if at least one
 path is {dead} or in {unknown} state. It returns {WARN} if at least
 one path is {disabled}. It also returns {WARN} if at least one path
 is in {standby} mode and the number of paths in {standby} mode is not
 equal to the number of {active} paths.
 By providing parameters you can configure the warn and crit levels for
 each state type.

inventory:
 One service per multipath device will be created. Paths
 to local disk are ignored.

item:
 The unique id of the path

[parameters]
