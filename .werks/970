Title: liveproxyd: handle situations with more then 1024 open files
Level: 2
Component: liveproxy
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1400056696
Class: fix

When you are using the Livestatus Proxy Daemon for connecting lots
of sites and you have lots of concurrent users then two things could
happen:

1. You might run out of allowed open files. The reason is that
per default on most Linux systems the number of files a process is
allowed to keep open is limited to 1024. The can be increased by changing
<tt>/etc/security/limits.conf</tt> and issue a <tt>ulimit -S -n unlimited</tt>
before starting <tt>liveproxyd</tt>. That latter one has now ben implemented
in the recent development OMD builds of the Check_MK Monitoring System. The
<tt>liveproxyd</tt> now also handles the out-of-files error situation
better and does not long run into a busy CPU loop. It waits for 5 seconds
and restarts itself instead.

2. Even if you increased the number of allowed open files, the
<tt>liveproxyd</tt> could never handle more than 1024 open files on most
Python versions (due to a limit of the system call <tt>select()</tt>. This
has been fixed by using the <tt>poll()</tt> system call.
