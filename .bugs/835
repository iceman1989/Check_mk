They still appearing as critical

by bs: is'nt this a "works as designed"?
only because of someone working on a problem, an application (aggregation) is still unavailable and should be shown as unavailable (e. g. in Hotline Callcenter)

2013-11-05 09:51:20: changed state discuss -> discuss
one more note by bs: maybe we better should add the acknoleged icon to the aggregation
and keep state unchanged
this would be e. g. very helpful for telefone hotline: They could tell customers:
Yes we have a known problem with application xyz and there is already someone working on
