Title: Livestatus grouping by check_interval does not work
Component: livestatus
State: works4me
Class: bug
Date: 2011-10-28 10:14:07
Targetversion: 

GET services
Columns: check_interval
Stats: state >= 0

==> invalid;998 -> seems that check_interval is a float and
cannot be used for grouping. We could force an integer here.

I've checked this out several times. Column type is float and
is groupable. Seems to work.
