When unmounting the tmpfs of an OMD site would should create a tarball
of tmp, without tmp/run. Before this we need to do some cleanup things:

- Nobody must have PID files or sockets in other place than tmp/run
  (fix apache and rrdcached)
- Create *all* directories already via skel (e.g. tmp/check_mk/piggyback
  is missing here)

When later mounting the tmpfs populate it from skel as usual and then
extract all files from the tarball that match *existing* directories.
