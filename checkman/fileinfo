title: Age and size of files
agents: windows, linux, freebsd, macosx, solaris
catalog: os/files
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the size and age of specific files
 in the target host's filesystem.
 You can set lower and upper
 limits on both the modification time and the size of
 a file. When the file is missing then the check will go
 {UNKNOWN}.

 This check needs some configuration in the agent,
 as the agent needs to know the information about
 which files need to be sent.

 Currently the linux and windows agents supports this type
 of check.

 For windows, the configuration is done in {check_mk.ini} in
 the section {[fileinfo]}. Put one or more entries of the
 format {path = C:\Some Dir\*.log} into this
 section. The agent will send all files that match
 the pattern. Wildcards are only allowed in the
 filename part, not in the directory path.

 For linux, the configuration is done via {fileinfo.cfg} located
 in the {$MK_CONFDIR} (usually {/etc/check_mk/fileinfo.cfg}).
 To add files to the check, simply add one path pattern per line.

item:
 The complete path name of the file as sent by
 the agent (this is case sensitive even when monitoring
 Windows).

 Please note: when referring to the item in
 {check_parameters}, make sure that backslashes
 (contained in Windows paths) are properly
 quoted. You need one escape level for the Python
 string and one for the regular expression.
 If you prefix the Python string with a {r}, then
 just the regular expression needs its double
 backslash (see examples). Without the {r} you
 would need four backslashes in a row in order to
 denote one backslash in the file's path.

examples:
 check_parameters += [
   # Alert if backup files are too small
   ( { "minsize" : (5000000, 10000000) },
     ALL_HOSTS, [ "File D:\\Backup\\.*.zip" ] ),

   # Alert if snapshot file are too old
   ( { "maxage" : (120, 180) },
     ALL_HOSTS, [ "File.*snapshot" ] ),
 ]

perfdata:
  Two values: the size of the file in bytes and the age
  of the file in seconds (the time since the last
  modification of the file).

inventory:
  For each file that the agent sends one service will
  be created.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check uses dictionary based
 parameters. Per default no parameters are set and
 the check is always OK (unless the file is missing).


 {"minage"}: A pair of integers for the warning and
 critical level of the minimum file age in seconds.
 A missing key or {None} disables the minimum age
 checking. The borders itself always belong to the
 better state, so {(60, 120)} will make the check
 OK as long as the age of the file is not exceeding
 60 seconds and warning if the age is 120 seconds
 or less.

 {"maxage"}: Pair of integers for the maximum file
 age in seconds.

 {"minsize"}: The minimum size of the file in bytes (pair of
 integers).

 {"maxsize"}: The maximum size.
