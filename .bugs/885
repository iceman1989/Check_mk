Title: Fewer mouseclicks in commands and actions
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2013-03-01 10:02:56
Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: feature

Two ideas in order to ease the user actions:

1. Make a user setting the completely disabled all confirms in Multisite and WATO.
2. When a user has done an action on hosts/services, do not display a separate
result page, but directly to back to the view. The result of the action is then
displayed in a floating div, that goes away if you hover over.
