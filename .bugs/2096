Title: Activate Changes on Global Settings page: confusing for mkeventd settings

When changing mkeventd related options via global settings dialog, the dialog does not show
the activate changes button. But the changes are only applied when switching the page to
event rule configuration page, clicking on the activate changes button there and then 
activating the changes. This is very unfriendly.

This should be changed! maybe this way: Add multiple possible "activate changes" buttons,
one for the general settings and one for the mkeventd.
