description:
 This check monitors three aspects of the client status
 of an Cisco Aironet access point: the number of clients
 logged in, their average signal strength and their average
 signal quality. You may provide levels for strength and quality.
 If zero clients are logged in, this check is always OK.

item:
 One of the three strings {"clients"}, {"strength"} or {"quality"}.

examples:
 # Warn if strength is worse than -85dB, crit if worse than -65dB
 aironet_default_strength_levels = (-85, -65)

 # Set levels for quality to 20 and 10 percent
 aironet_default_quality_levels = (20, 10)

perfdata:
 The number of clients, the average signal strength (this is a
 negative value) or the average quality - depending on the check
 item used.

inventory:
 If at least one client is logged in, all three checks will
 be generated.

[parameters]
warning (int): Warning level for signal strength or quality. Note that
 the signal strength levels are always negative. Levels are ignored
 for the check item {"clients"} and should be set to {None} in that case.
critical (int): Critical levels, {None} in case of {"clients"}.

[configuration]
aironet_default_strength_levels (int, int): Default levels for signal
 strength. They are preset to {(-80, -70)}.
aironet_default_quality_levels (int, int): Default levels for signal
 quality. They are preset to {(40, 20)}.
