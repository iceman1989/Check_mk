Title: Change handling of undefined columns

We can introduce a livestatus option that affects the handling of 
unknown columns. The problem is that if in a new version of Livestatus
are introduced columns and new versions of addons use them that
old versions of Livestatus will not be compatible. If the old
versions would not crash but simply output empty columns in that
case, the problem could be tackled.

Proposition for a parameter:

unused_columns=warn ---> Log a warning in that case
unused_columns=fail ---> Query fails (current behavious)
unused_columns=ignore ---> Do not log

In case of warn/ignore a default value will be sent for
the unknown columns, e.g. None/null in python/json mode and
an empty column in CVS.

We could make 'warn' into a default.

Multisite must then be aware of the possibility that a columns
value is None. This is easier than just querying a livestatus
version and make a switch.
