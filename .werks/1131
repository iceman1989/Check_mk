Title: esx_vsphere_hostsystem.maintenance: fixed misspelling in service description
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1413811961
Class: fix

"Maintenace Mode" has been renamed to "Maintenance Mode".
Note: This is only a minor incompatible change, since this check has no performance data.<br>
If you have any rules specifically configured for this check (e.g disabled services)
you need to update the service description filter.
