Title: ntp check does not disable dns lookups and uses ipv6 as default with newer ntp versions

check_mk_agents ntp check calls 'ntpq -p' as check command. This uses dns to resolve
addresses of ntp servers and uses ipv6 as default if available. Both may lead to
timeouts of the check. Calling 'ntpq -4np' might be a better choice.

Solution not clear. -n introduces other problems.

Adding -n causes trouble when using pool.ntp.org and stuff,
because the IP addresses are always changing. That make
the ntp.peers check unhappy.
