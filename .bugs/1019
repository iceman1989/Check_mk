Title: Oracle Tablespace Monitoring - TEMP Tablespaces
Component: checks
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2013-09-04 11:22:25
Targetversion: 1.4.0

It is senseless to apply thresholds to TEMP tablespaces in oracle. On startup, the tablespace
is small, but once allocated it grows and grows, but never gets smaller again. So we should
either completely remove those tablespaces or at least disable the thresholds by default.

2014-12-05 18:01:00: changed state open -> done
Obsoleted by our new ORACLE monitoring.
