description:
 This checks monitors the state and laser parameters of interfaces of the
 ADVA FSP 3000 scalable optical transport solution.

 State information is collected from the SNMP IF-MIB parameters {ifAdminStatus} and
 {ifOperStatus}. Laser information is collected from the FspR7-MIB parameters
 {currentPmSnapshotOutputPower} and {currentPmSnapshotInputPower}.

 Lower and upper critical limits can be configured for the input (received)
 and output (transmit) power of the laser. Per default, not limits are imposed,
 since meaningful values depend on the type of interface.

 A {WARN} state is triggered if no laser power information can be found.
 Service interfaces (item name beginning with "S") do not have laser power
 information, so that non-existent laser power information is ignored for these
 interfaces.

item:
 There are three allowed ways to specify an interface: {1}: the last component
 of the SNMP OID number (as string), the {ifDescr} of the port or the {ifAlias}
 of the port. If you are using the alias, you have to make sure that it is
 unique by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check
 for uniqueness.
 The default is to use the {ifDescr}.

perfdata:
 The input and output laser power

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each interface that fulfills
 configurable conditions.  Per default these are interfaces which currently
 are {up} and are of type {1} (other), {6} (ethernetCsmacd), and {56}
 (fibreChannel).

[parameters]
parameters (dict):
        {"limits_input_power"}: a tuple of lower and upper critical values in dBm,
        {"limits_output_power"}: a tuple of lower and upper critical values in dBm

[configuration]
adva_fsp_if_inventory_porttypes (list of strings):  List of interface types the inventory should create checks for.
  Default is {[ '1', '6', '56' ]}, which means that all other, ethernet and fibre channel interfaces
  will be monitored. Please see the SNMP MIB description of {ifType} for a complete list of port types.

adva_fsp_if_inventory_portstates (list of strings): Per default this variable is set to {['1']}, which means that
  only ports found in the state {up} are being added to the monitoring. If you set this to {['1', '2', '5']} then
  also ports in state {down} and {dormant} will be monitored.

adva_fsp_if_inventory_uses_description (boolean): Whether inventory should use
  the interface description as item (instead of the interface index). Default
  is {True}.

adva_fsp_if_inventory_uses_alias (boolean): Whether inventory should use
  the interface alias as item. In this case make sure that it is
  unique by configuring useful aliases in the switch. Check_MK does not check
  for uniqueness. Default is {False}.
