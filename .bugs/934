Title: fileinfo.groups and "patterns" check_parameter
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-07-08 09:56:03
Targetversion: future

The fileinfo.groups checks evaluates the parameter fileinfo_groups upon inventory
and create an autocheck file with a pattern key.

In the WATO inventory screen the valuespec for the fileinfo.groups parameters is
displayed ( which does NOT contain a pattern key, just age/count/etc. )
This raises in error when multisite debug is used ( valuespec validation fails )

Additionally the static checks for fileinfo.groups is not working because
it is not possible to define patterns in the fileinfo_groups valuespec

Solution:
Add patterns to fileinfo_groups valuespec

Has been cleaned up by removing the pattern attribute and adding a precompile
function to the check which precompiles the patterns of a fileinfo group
just like the logwatch check
