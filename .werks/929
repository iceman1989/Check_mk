Title: windows agent: now able to include and execute additional local and plugin scripts as different user
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: feature

In the <tt>[local]</tt> and <tt>[plugin]</tt> sections the new option <tt>include</tt> has been introduced.
With this option you can configure additional local and plugin directories, which should get parsed.
You can also configure that the scripts in the given directories should get executed as a different user.
<br><br>
Example configuration:<br>

F+:check_mk.ini
[plugins]
    # The scripts in the following folder are executed as user \\ab
    include \\ab = C:\users\ab\plugins
    # The scripts in the following folder are executed without any
    # changes to the user permission
    include - = C:\scripts\plugins
F-:

<b>Important:</b> Keep in mind that the agent needs the permission to run
scripts as other user. Internally it uses the windows command <tt>runas /User:</tt>
which prompts for a password if the windows agent has no permission to change to this user.
