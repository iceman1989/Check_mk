Title: BI: Aggregation Groups snapin should show remote aggregates
Component: bi
State: open

Targetversion: 1.1.13i1
Class: wontfix

The reason is clear: BI is a pure mulitisite feature. But the wish to have
the aggregations groups of other sites shown is also clear. It could be solved
like in the WATO folder snapin before 1.1.13. Simply create links to the other
sites BI aggregation groups which open the multisite BI GUI of the other site.

This leaves many problems open, however. The frame from the remote site will
contain inconsistent links. I thinks the whole idea of remote BI aggregates
does not work well together with the concept of BI.
