Title: Fix check_notify_count: notification had been counted twice
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

The active check for counting the notifications of users have been fixed.
The dummy contact <tt>check-mk-notify</tt> is now being handled separately.
We make a distinction between <i>raw notifications</i> - notifications created
by the monitoring - and <i>user notification</i> - those being sent out
to users.

Note: in the rule based notifications one raw notification can create several
user notifications. Other raw notifcations might create no user notification
at all.
