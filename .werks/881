The relatively new <tt>rmon_stats</tt> check creates one new service per network
interface (if RMON is enabled on your switch). In order to keep low the number
of services and the SNMP traffic this check is now <b>disabled per default</b>.

In order to have RMON checks created please activate RMON in the rule set
<i>Network Interface and Switch Port Inventory</i>.
