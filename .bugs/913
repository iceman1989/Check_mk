Title: Painter contents should be aligned vertically top when one painter is higher than others

The default vertical alignment is middle. This is ok and should be kept for regular
layouts where every painter fits in one row (text should be aligned middle to the
images and perfometers).

But in case there is very long status output which wraps to several lines, the other
painter contents should be aligned to top.
