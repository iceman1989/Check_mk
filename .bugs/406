Title: Set in_notification_period filter in problem views
Component: multisite
State: wontfix
Class: cleanup
Date: 2011-10-28 09:22:31
Targetversion: 1.2.0

In all Multisite views showing problems (also dashboard_...) the
notification period filter should be set to 1 so that problem
out of the notification period are not being shown.

We rather let it the way it currently is. Could confuse
users otherwise.
