Title: WATO inventory ignores already inventorized checks which does not exist anymore
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: fix

Previous versions totally failed to inventorize when a host already has a service
inventorized which belongs to a check which is not existant anymore. It terminated
with "Failed to inventorize Fritzbox-Alt: 'fritz.uptime'". This error is skipped over
now by simply ignoring the check.
