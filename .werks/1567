Title: postfix_mailq: speedup in Linux agent for large mail queues
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417620214
Class: feature

Instead of the <tt>mailq</tt> command we now use <tt>du</tt> and <tt>wc</tt> in order to count
the number and size o requests. This is substantially faster, since <tt>mailq</tt> needs
to open every single mail file. Thanks to Max Matslovfa.
