Title: problem checking pacemaker cluster: rscstatus deprecated
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: cleanup

Currently, check_mk_agent attempts to get cluster status information
with cl_status. It runs the command 'cls_status rscstatus', but in
newer pacemaker clusters that results in the following error, which
ends up in syslog:

> cl_status[27331]: 2013/08/07_13:00:28 ERROR: Cannot get cluster
resource status
> cl_status[27331]: 2013/08/07_13:00:28 ERROR: REASON: Resource is
managed by crm.Use crm tool to query resource

The man page for cl_status states:

> rscstatus
>   Show the status of cluster resources. Status will be one of: local,
foreign, all or none.
>
>      Note
>        This option is deprecated, it is obsolete in Pacemaker
clusters.


The other cl_status commands still work, though.
