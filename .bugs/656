Custom notification:

  Sends a test notification with the given text for all selected items.
  This can be used to notify admins about an issue regarding the selected
  hosts or services.
  Selecting the forced option the notifications will be sent out ignoring
  time restrictions.
  Using the broadcast option you can send out notifications to all contacts
  (escalated and non-escalated).

Acknowledge:

  When a service problem is acknowledged, future notifications about problems
  are temporarily disabled until the service changes from its current state.
  If you want acknowledgement to disable notifications until the service recovers,
  check the 'Sticky Acknowledgement' checkbox.

In general: Take a look at the nagios cgis there are useful texts for the commands.
