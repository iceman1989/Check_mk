title: Performance indicators of Apache web server
agents: linux
catalog: app/apache
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check parses the information provided by the Apache status module.
 If you have enabled that module (on Debian/Ubuntu this is the default),
 then below the URL {/server-status} Apache show interesting information
 about the number of connections and the like. The agent plugin {apache_status}
 fetches that data and this check processes it. The status is always OK,
 but it fetches interesting performance data.

 As a preparation you need to install the agent plugin {apache_status}
 into your agent's plugins directory (usually {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}).
 The plugin tries to autodetect all running apache servers. If that fails
 for some reason you need to create the configuration file
 {/etc/check_mk/apache_status.cfg} and list your servers here. Write
 a Python list of dicts for protocol, servername and port.
 With the optional item 'page' its posible to change the status page from server-status to a
 name you want

examples:
 servers = [
 {
  'protocol' : 'http',
  'address'  : 'localhost',
  'port'     : 80 ,
 },
 {
  'protocol' : 'https',
  'address'  : 'localhost',
  'port'     : 443 ,
  'page'     : 'server-status-2',
 },
 ]

inventory:
 One service per Apache server will be created.

item:
 A string-combination of servername and port, e.g. {127.0.0.1:5000}.

perfdata:
 This check outputs lots of performance variables since this is the
 purpose of the check. Please look at the shipped PNP template for
 details.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): a dictionary with the optional key

 {"OpenSlots"} : (int, int) -  warn/crit levels for the number of remaining open slots
