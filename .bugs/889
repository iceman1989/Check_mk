Title: unify CPU load checks, avoid incompatible check parameters
Component: checks
State: done
Date: 2013-03-25 11:23:06
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: bug

Several checks are in the group "cpu_load". All these checks need to
support predecitve levels by using get_levels(). Resolution: work with
an include file that does the actual checking.

All three CPU load checks now use a new include file.

Found yet more of those and fixed them.
