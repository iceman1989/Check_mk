Title: Invalid reload after command execution
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done

Targetversion: 1.2.3i5

When you issue a command on hosts/services and confirm then you see a blue
message with a link back to the view. In that situation there must be no
reload of the view container. But this happens. If you wait long enough then
hosts/services get visible again.

An even better resolution would be to drop that intermediate page at
all and instead print the result of the command in a kind of overlay
window that goes away after a view seconds or when you hover over
it. That saves one mouse click.

Disabled reload after execution of actions and also
during confirmation.
