title: F5 Big-IP: Load Balancing Pools
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/f5

distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check queries the MIB tables of F5 BIG-IP loadbalancers (local traffic
 managers) for the status of any load balancing pools. It gathers the number
 of loadbalancers backing the pool and how many of those are working. It
 doesn't currently honor the 'MinUpMembers' parameter that can be set to
 trigger actions for the pool if too many members fail.

 It supports devices running the 9.0 and above releases of the F5 OS. It's
 tested against 9.3 devices.

 If there are down or disabled nodes, the names of the nodes are
 also printed in the service output. They are identified using the
 following oids: ltmPoolMemberMonitorState, ltmPoolMemberMonitorStatus,
 ltmPoolMemberSessionStatus

examples:
 # Let the Pool named ABC on your first F5 be in WARNING state when it reaches 5 active members or in CRITICAL for anything between 3 and 0.
 check_parameters += [
 ( (5, 3), [ "f5-1" ], [ "Load Balancing Pool Pool_ABC" ]),
 ]


inventory:
 The check collects a list of the pools defined on a system. It will include
 non-enabled ones, as this is considered a temporary state.

[parameters]
warning (int): issue a warning if there are less than warn members left in a load balancing pool

crit (int): go to critical state if there are less than crit members left in a load balancing pool. Note: 0 active members will always result in a critical state.

[configuration]
f5_bigip_pool_default_levels = (int, int): The default levels for all F5 BIG-IP pool checks. This is preset to {(2, 1)}.
