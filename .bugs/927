It seems that there are still some performance problems when using livecheck
Scenario: 16000 services
20 livecheck helpers, no livecheck overflows

When running nagios the service check latency goes up (7 minutes and further)

2013-10-18 21:55:02: changed state open -> done
Livecheck no longer exists
