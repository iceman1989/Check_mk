description:
 This check monitors the rate of CRC errors on MAC level
 on each of the radios of an Cisco Aironet access point.

item:
 The number of the radio - usually {1} or {2} (integer).

examples:
 # Set levels for wanring and critical to an error rate of
 # 2.0 and 20.0 per second
 aironet_default_error_levels = (2.0, 20.0)

perfdata:
 The error rate (as a counter value)

inventory:
 On check is generated for each radio present (even if not activated)

[parameters]
warning (float): Error rate in errors/sec at which a warning level is
 triggered.
critical (float): Critical level for error rate

[configuration]
aironet_default_error_levels (float, float): Default levels for error
 rate, used by inventorized checks. This is preset to {(1.0, 10.0)}.
