Title: Logout or password change and relogin leads to side.py
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2012-05-10 10:33:12
Targetversion: 1.2.0

When logging out and in again - or when you are logged out due
to a password change - then you are not logged into the main
frameset but into side.py (or whatever frame had done the
logout int the first place).

Happens with cookie based authentication.

I added some changes several days ago which might have fixed the problem.
I tested this yesterday and was unable to reproduce these problems. So if
you experience any problems please provide a reproducable way to get this
error.
