Title: mk_sap: Fixed some wrong calculated values (decimal numbers)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i4

Class: fix

The values provided by SAP seem to be integers with a second value
which can be used to tell the asking program the number of decimals.
e.g. when this value states 2, a load value of 901 is converted to
9.01. This value has not been used in the past which lead to odd
check results.
