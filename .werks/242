Title: Parameters for clustered services can now be configured on the cluster host

Class: fix

The check parameters of a clustered service were taken from one of the clusters node.
Any parameters for the cluster got ignored.

This fix allows to configure the parameters of a clustered service on the cluster itself.
However, if the clustered service has no configured parameters, the parameters from the nodes
are used instead.
