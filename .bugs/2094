It is hard to diagnose memory problems caused by the BI-Cache which increases
the memory of the sites apache processes dramatically. While building the cache,
there are often opened a lot of other apache processes, which might lead into
system memory issues, swapping etc.

There is no single value/check to point the user to this issue/solution.

It would be nice to have a clearer view on the number of apache processes and
their consumed memory.

At the moment it is neccessary to install the apache_status agent plugin
and create a ps.perf check which monitors the site apaches processes to get
all information.

Another soultion would be to reduce the number of maximum allowed apache
processes within OMD.
