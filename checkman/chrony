title: NTP time synchronization using chrony
agents: linux
catalog: os/services
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check uses the output of {chronyc tracking} in order to
 check the time synchronization when using {chrony}. The check
 is very similar to {ntp}, which monitors the {ntpd}, but it
 does not support jitter.

 You can set levels for the maximum stratum and for the time offset
 in milliseconds. The configuration is compatible with {ntp}.

 When {chrony} is not found running, the check goes to {CRIT}.

examples:
 # At stratum of 3 or more it gets critical
 # Warn/Crit levels for offset is 5 ms / 10 ms
 ntp_default_levels = (3, 5.0, 10.0)

perfdata:
 One variable: the time {offset} in ms

inventory:
 If chrony is running, then one service is being created.

[parameters]
max_stratum (int): The stratum at which the check gets critical
warning (float): the offset in ms at which a warning is triggered
critical (float): the critical offset in ms

[configuration]
ntp_default_levels (int, float, float): The global default levels for all checks
 of this type. This is preset to {(10, 200.0, 500.0)} (which means that the check
 gets critical if the stratum is {10} or higher).
