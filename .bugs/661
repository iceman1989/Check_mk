Title: Do no monitor host leads to host monitored on all sites

Targetversion: 1.2.0

If you set a host to "do not monitor" in the "monitored on" attribute,
then that host will be monitored on *all* sites instead of on none.
Solution: currently no site: tag is set in that case, but we rather
should set an empty site: tag.

Instead of removing the site: tag we now add an empty site: tag
