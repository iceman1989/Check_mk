If you replicate to a host that has a clock that drifted into future something
can break.
We should not replicate to systems that have fundamental problems; the 
replication may still work, but there may be much larger issues be caused in the
followup.

In my opinion enforcing a correct time is not the task
of Check_MK. And detecting time differences is not easy
to implement in a clean way.
