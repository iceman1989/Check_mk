Title: Snapins should not show error on Nagios reload

When Nagios reloads and there is a Livestatus error, then
the Snapins should - on their refresh - not display that
error but reject the Ajax response completely and stay in
their old state.

This is done at the moment by clearing the contents instead of displaying an error.
