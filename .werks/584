Title: agent_vsphere: special agent now handles non-standard https port correctly
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1

Class: fix

The special agent vsphere to monitor ESX-Servers and vcenters can be configured to use a
non-standard port for the vsphere https connection. This might be useful for firewall
traversals etc.

The configuration was possible before this fix in WATO, but it was never used, so that the
default https port 443 was always used.

With this fix the port which is actually configured in WATO will be used for https.

If a vcenter is queried including the check_mk_agent, the check_mk_agent will still be queried
on the standard check_mk_agent port 6556, whereas the https connection port will be the one
configured in WATO.
