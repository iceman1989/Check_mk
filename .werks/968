Check_MK now has a new alternative API for notification scripts, which allows
them to be configured via WATO. The classical API provided the possibility
of a list of strings that was passed to the script in form of variables like
<tt>PARAMETER_1</tt>, <tt>PARAMETER_2</tt>, etc. The new API passes parameters
according to keys of a WATO-configured dictionary, like <tt>PARAMETER_FROM</tt>
and <tt>PARAMETER_REPLY_TO</tt>.

Two notification scripts have already been converted to use the new API: <tt>mail</tt>
(sending HTML emails) and <tt>mkeventd</tt> (forwarding to the Event Console).

The configuration of a notification script does only work with the new
<i>Rule Based Notifications</i> can be done at two places:

<ul>
<li>In new rulesets below <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i> &rarr; <i>Monitoring Configuration</i> &rarr; <i>Notifications</i></li>
<li>In a notification rule</li>
</ul>

Both configurations are being merged on a per-key basis. That way you
can e.g. setup a <tt>From:</tt> header for your outgoing emails via
a global rule, but select various different <tt>Reply-To:</tt> addresses
in different notification rules.
If a configuration key appears both in <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i> and
in a notification rule then the latter one has precedence.

Within that effort the HTML email script has been made far more configurable. You
can now configure:

<ul>
<li>The From- and Reply-To Address</li>
<li>The subjects for host and service notifications</li>
<li>An URL-Prefix for your Multisite interface (this makes hosts and services
in the notifications clickable</li>
<li>A choice of optional information to be displayed in the emails</li>
</ul>
