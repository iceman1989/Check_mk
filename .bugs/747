Title: Replication must replicate auth.secret
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-11 18:00:47
Targetversion: 1.2.0

The replication must not only ship htpasswd, but
also auth.secret. Otherwise a single-singon to the
remote sites will not work. This is not only needed
for addons like PNP, but also for internal web
services like that for L4m.

Is now replicated.
