description:
 This check is used to monitor successful email delivery through
 Symantec Brightmail Scanner appliances.
 The check allows to define levels for all parameters the device supports.
 It will report an {OK} state if either no level was defined or the threshold
 was not reached. Otherwise it will accordingly report a {WARN} or {CRIT} state.

item:
 The name of the queue, usually delivery, inbound or outbound.


inventory:
 The check creates one item per queue found.

perfdata:
  The check does not support performance data.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): To allow fine-grained and optional configuration, this check uses a dictionary.

                   {"connections"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the number of connections. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status.
                   {"messageRate"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the number of messages delivered. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status.
                   {"dataRate"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the amount of data processed. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status, and the unit is undocumented by Symantec.
                   {"queuedMessages"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the number of messages currently queued. This is probably the most
                   important to monitor. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status.
                   {"queueSize"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the size of this queue. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status. Note that the unit is undocumented by Symantec.
                   {"deferredMessages"} - a pair of two integer values to be used as WARN/CRIT
                   level for the number of messages in a deferred state. The defaults will be None, None
                   equalling an {OK} status.
