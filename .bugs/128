Title: df trends: Peak values after changing the trend_range

Class: bug

After changing the trend_range to a larger time the check reports a peak
value which is wrong. It might be needed to detect such a change and reset
the values.

I've investigated this. The current behaviour is correct.
In our demo server there was a filesystem with a trend
of aprox. 800 MB/24h. This was nicely visible in the trend
graph, with a light descending slope. I now increased the
trend range to 48h. Now the trend value "jumped" to aprox 
1600 MB/48h. This is - however - the same value as 800 MB/24.
What's not nice about this is that in the graph it looks like
a jump.

A possible solution would be to normalize the graph to 
MB/day, even if the trend range is for example one week.

==> RESOLUTION:

I think we'll make it like this:

df.include: the performance data growth and trend will both
be normalized to MB/24h - regardless of the trend_range
parameter.

PNP template: the graphs will be updated. The growth graph
will be scaled to MB per *minute*. When painting the avg, last
and max we can also print MB / 24h sec as an additional information.
This information is only relevant to the user - however - if the
growth is very static.

In the migration notes we have to describe this. The performance
data will be inconsistent if the user has used an other trend
range than 24h.

We will do this after 1.1.11i3 is out.

Is done like described. Throrough testing will need some time,
though...
