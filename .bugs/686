Title: Dashboard/Sidebar on Chrome sometimes not sized
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.0

It seems like we miss an initial resize() event on Chrome.
This affects both the sidebar and the dashboard. Can we
simulate that event somehow? Currently the dashboard
and sidebar sometimes only work after a manual resize
of the browser window.

We are using window.onload and body.onload now in addition.
Seems to work nicely on Chrome and does not break anything
on Firefox.
