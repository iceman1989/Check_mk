Setup of check_MK agent on FreeBSD:
-----------------------------------

The check_mk agent is not available as a port so far.
This means you have to manually download and install it.


First we'll be installing a few small ports that allow us to access more
monitoring data:

sysutils/muse
sysutils/ipmitool
devel/libstatgrab


Then we'll enable inetd in rc.conf:

inetd_enable=yes
inetd_flags=-wW


We download the most current agent:

cd /usr/local/bin
fetch 'http://git.mathias-kettner.de/git/?p=check_mk.git;a=blob_plain;f=agents/check_mk_agent.freebsd;hb=HEAD'

-rwx------  1 root  wheel  11599 Mar 15 15:59 /usr/local/bin/check_mk


We make it resolveable by adding it to the service names list in /etc/services:

check_mk	6556/tcp   #check_mk agent


We add an entry to the inetd configuration that ensures it will be run if someone connects to the port.

check_mk	stream	tcp	nowait		root	/usr/local/bin/check_mk check_mk


And we set up minimum security in /etc/hosts.allow

# Allow nagios server to access us
check_mk : ip_of_nagios_server : allow


# At last,we restart inetd to read in the new config and bring it up
/etc/rc.d/inetd start



If access doesn't work right away you can test the tcp wrapper settings using
tcpdchk.
Alternatively you can of course also use key-based ssh or any other more secure
means of transportation.
