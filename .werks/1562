Title: Move manual checks into a new WATO module
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417599830
Class: feature

The rulesets for configuration manual checks (i.e. checks not created by the service
discovery) have been moved into a new WATO module <i>Manual Checks</i>. This should
save users from accidentally using these rules instead of their counterparts for
invetorized checks.
