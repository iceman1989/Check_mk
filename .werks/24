Title: cisco_wlc: removed check configuration parameter ap_model
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1383741998
Class: fix

The parameter ap_model couldn't work at all, because the item name
of the cisco_wlc only reflected the access point name.
Therefore, a missing access point could only be detected by its name.
