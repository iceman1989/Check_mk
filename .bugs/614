Title: Error sending commands in Mobile UI
Component: mobile

I am receiving this error in the Check_MK Mobile interface:

      ERROR showing view: too many values to unpack

I am using Check_MK version 1.2.0b2.  Here are the steps I am taking to
receive this error:

- Log in to Mobile interface using a Blackberry, Android, or Google Chrome
- Click on "Hosts > Problems (unhandled)"
- Click on the hostname of a downed host
- Click on "context"
- Click on "Host status"
- Click "Commands" at the bottom of the page
- Expand the "Acknowledge" section
- Enter a comment (Ex. "Known issue")
- Click the "Acknowledge" button
- Select yes at the prompt > "Do you really want to acknowledge the
problems of the 1 hosts?"

After this, the screen just displays the message: "ERROR showing view: too
many values to unpack".

The alert remains unacknowledged as well.

Should work now.
