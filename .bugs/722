Title: Megaraid pdisks/ldisks naming scheme makeover
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: cleanup

after the 1.2 series we should redo the item names for the megaraid devices.
currently we have not something sane like c0e0s0 (controller, enclosure, slot)
but instead inject the controller id into a letter that prefixes the enclosure id.
this is undocumented and not helpful for the end-user - but needed to stay compatible.
We should just stop being compatible at some point.

If in doubt, see megaraid_pdisks_adapterstr in megaraid_pdisks ;)
