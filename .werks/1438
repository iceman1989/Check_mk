Title: quicksearch: fixed various non-working quicksearch filters
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415962691

Some of the view filters got renamed in the latest releases.
These changes were not considered in the quicksearch plugins which refer to these filters.

As a result the hostgroup (<i>hg:</i>) search did not work properly.
Also the some multiple search filters (e.g. <i>h: test s: cpu hg: testgroup</i>) did omit the
specified host- and servicegroup patterns.
