Title: Added iCalendar import for generating timeperiods e.g. for holidays
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415272776
Class: feature

The timeperiod management module of WATO has been extended with an import
mode vor iCalendar (*.ics) files. This can be used to easily create timeperiods
for holidays which then can be used to exclude them from your other timeperiods.

There are a lot of pages on the internet which provide you with iCalendar including
the appointments for either the holidays of specific years. They might also contain
appointments which have a recurrence configured, e.g. on a yearly base. The import
currently deals with monthly and yearly recurrences of appointments by resolving them
for the configured time horizon.

After interpreting the iCalendar file, you will be redirected to the timeperiod
creation dialog where you can either modify the prefilled values or just confirm
the dialog to finally create the timeperiod.
