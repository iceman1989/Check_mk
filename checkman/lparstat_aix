title: lparstat on AIX - CPU utilization and assignment for LPARs
agents: aix
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 The check executes the {lparstat} command on AIX and reports different
 logical partition (LPAR) related information and statistics extracted from
 it's output. See section perfdata for description of the single values.

 The check always returns {OK} state.

perfdata:
 The following 8 float values:

 {user}: CPU utilization in user space in percent

 {sys}: CPU utilization in kernel space in percent

 {wait}: CPU time for I/O wait in percent

 {idle}: CPU idle time in percent

 {physc}: The number of physical processors consumed by the LPAR

 {entc}: The percentage of the entitled capacity consumed by the LPAR

 {lbusy}: The percentage of logical processor(s) utilization that occurred while executing at the user and system level

 {app}: The available physical processors in the shared pool

inventory:
 On each LPAR one check is generated.
