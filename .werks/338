Title: Introduce time limit on availability queries

The availability view now imposes an upper limit on the execution of the
underlying livestatus query. The default is 30 seconds. This can be configured
in the reporting options. This limit keeps the system usable in situations
where a query over a long time range would need a very long time to execute.
