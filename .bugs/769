Title: Editing folder information does not set site dirty
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-06-13 11:43:11
Targetversion: 1.2.0

I did the following:

1. create a site master and slvae
2. create two hosts and the master
3. restart

--> works

4. now change the folder properties to "monitored on slave"

--> Slave site is not being set to dirty. Activate changes
leaves you with zero hosts.

Fixed.
