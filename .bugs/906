Title: logwatch.ec: Need some fallback mechanism if processing takes too long
Component: checks
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.2

Nagios kills Check_MK when it takes too long. When e.g. logwatch.ec is taking
more than 60 seconds, the script is terminated and all unprocessed messages
are lost. This results in data-loss and must be prevented!

This is not only based on the amount of messages to be processed at once,
when the event console is hanging or taking too long for any reason,
the pending messages are lost. Just limiting the number of messages is
no real solution.

Solution:

Implement a new interface to the event console - a spool directory. In OMD
this is located in var/mkeventd/spool. After the select() loop of the 
sockets, process one file which name is not starting with a "." from this
directory (if available).

logwatch.ec: Add a third message processing mode, which writes a file into
this spool directory named ".<hostname>_<item>_timestamp". Escape the "/"
with "\" in the file name. After writing rename the file to the same name
without the leading dot.
