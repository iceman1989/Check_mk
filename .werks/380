Title: jolokia_metrics.mem: PNP-Template now handles non existant max values
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix

Targetversion: future

With some application servers the maximum values for memory are not provided
by the agent. The checks did already handle this, but the PNP graph could
not be displayed in this case.
