Title: Handle limit-settings sensefully at availability reporting

The problem is: we cannot simply us Limit: when querying statehist, since this will
create invalid availability data - silently. The Limit: needs to be applied on the
number of result rows, i.e. hosts and services. This cannot be done with Livestatus
but would need to be done in the AV GUI.

Furthermore: an AV-report with 1000 services could be very harmful when it
comes to performance.

One solution could be to hide the AV-Button whenever a query produces more
than X results. 

Another solution could be to implement the Limit just as it should be - 
i.e. count the number of lines in the AV GUI.
