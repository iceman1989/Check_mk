Somebody said that cmk -N HOSTNAME outputs always all
legacy checks, not only that of a specific host.
Check and maybe fix this.

The legacy checks are only shown for the configured hosts. But what is shown is the extra_nagios_conf.
This is clear since cmk can not decide for which hosts this is needed. So this needs to be included
for all hosts.
