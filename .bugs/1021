Title: Multisite title shows only site-name (should show site alias)

It would be more user friendly if the title of the window / tab would show
the alias of the site instead of the site-id. The normal user does not
see the site-id in many situations. In most cases the site-alias is used.

A site has no alias. There is just an alias for a Multisite connectin
in the central site. But the site has a global option "HTML-Title of HTML Multisite GUI".
There you can add an arbitrary text.
