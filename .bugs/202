Title: Cleanup check API: drop parameter checktype from inventory function
Component: core
State: done
Class: cleanup
Date: 2011-03-06 10:25:28
Fun: 0

The first parameter - the checktype - is never used. Remove it.
From all checks. From the API. But make Check_MK somehow detect
oldfashioned checks and stay compatible. Also remove the middle
component in the checks still returning triples at inventory.

2011-08-19 21:39:24: changed state open -> done
Old style is still supported. Shipped checks are all converted.
