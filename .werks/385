Title: Better error handling for invalid service regex in rule conditions
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1387299554
Class: fix

Previous versions of the rule editor in WATO did not check whether or not
the regular expressions provided for matching services are valid. This
change adds a regular expression validation.
