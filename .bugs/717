Title: MegaRaid BBU check should handle learning state

Class: feature

Most MegaRAID controllers come with a rechargable Li battery for the backup voltage.
This voltage is used to sustain power to the cache ram should the power fail or the OS crash.
Once the system comes up, the outstanding writes are flushed to disk before OS boot starts.

The newest models use a flash memory bank instead that is fed using a supercap that lasts 
long enough to copy the ram onto flash.

All non-flash models need to do maintenance on their batteries to avoid gas buildup and 
to test remaining capacity. This is called a learn cycle and occurs roughly once a month
,but the controller does not support setting a schedule.

During the learn cycle, the controller is set to write-through and then the battery is 
discharged a few times, and our check starts to look like a christmas tree.

We need to handle the learn cycle which is detectable.
If the agent reports "learn cycle requested: yes" then it will sstart at some time, 
and if it says "learn cycle active: yes" then it is running already.

Added a fix that suppresses all errors during the learn cycle.
This is not the complete-est solution, but the cleanest one.
