Title: Allow availability of multisite BI aggregates at once
Level: 2
Component: reporting
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: feature

Views containing multisite BI aggregates now also have the button <i>Availability</i> at
the top of the view. Multisite BI aggregates can thus be displayed in one availability
table - just as for hosts and services.
