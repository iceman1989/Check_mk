Title: Valuespecs: Fixed several possible HTML injections in valuespecs

Several HTML injections in valuespecs of different types (mostly used in WATO)
were missing good escaping of values. This has been added to prevent HTML
code injections which could be used for XSS attacks. This only affects WATO
and logged in users which are permitted to use WATO and open the page
(e.g. the list of rules) which displays the values.
