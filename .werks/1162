Title: User profiles can not be edited on WATO remote sites anymore
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1414398442
Class: fix

In previous versions it was possible for users to edit their own
user profile (language, password, ...) on WATO remote sites. This
was an problem, because it leads to inconsistent settings between
the master and remote site, because the changes on the remote site
are not synced to the master.

The edit dialog of the user profile has been removed/disabled for
all users of the remote site of a WATO distributed setup.
