In WATO if you are an unpriviledged user you might have write access to some
lower subfolders but not to the upper folders.  This is perfectly common,
because that way the monitoring administrator can delegate tasks for certain
classes of hosts to his collegues.

Previously, however, you couldn't navigate to the lower folders without
faking the URL. This has been fixed now. If you are located in a folder
without having permissions to it you won't see any hosts of that folder,
but still you see the subfolders and also can enter these.

Also this fix removes that buttons for actions on a folder if you do
not have write permissions to it.
