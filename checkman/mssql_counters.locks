 This check monitors locking related information of MSSQL tablespaces
 like for example the number of deadlocks per second or lock requests.

 The check has been developed with MSSQL Server 2008 R2 but should
 work with other versions too.

 This check needs the Check_MK mssql.vbs plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

 The MSSQL instance name and the tablespace name separated by a space.

perfdata:
 lock_requests/sec(int): Number of requested locks per second.
 lock_timeouts/sec(int): Number of lock timeouts per second.
 number_of_deadlocks/sec(int): Number of deadlocks per second.
 lock_waits/sec(int): Number of lock waits per second.

inventory:
 One separate check for each tablespace will be created.
