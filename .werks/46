Title: Fixed editing contactgroup assignments of hosts or folders with "-" in names
Level: 2

Class: fix

Contactgroups can have "-" chars in the name. On the host/folder
pages of WATO, contactgroups can be assigned to hosts/folders. When
assigning contactgroups with "-" in the name, the assignment has not
been saved.

In last i-releases, we introduced a feature which checks
for invalid URL variable names. It filters out variable
names which contain unwanted chars. The "-" is not evil
and is allowed again now.
