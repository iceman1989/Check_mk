Title: PNP graphs and localtime
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness
State: wontfix

Targetversion: future

If the user and the monitoring server exist in different timezones, multisite
is not smart enough in order to handle this. the problem is with PNP graphs
- if the user views them, he ends up with time information recorded on the
nagios server. This breaks the UI logic, and worse, he can't even tell what
timezone the server is running in.

It might be possible to fudge with the numbers when calling PNP.  Otherwise we
could at least add timezone info to the output, but this would only work if
there's just a single monitoring host (thus useless)

Probably hard to fix in PNP. We'll wait for some solution in the
future.
