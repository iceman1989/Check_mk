Title: f5_bigip_pool: limits to the number of active nodes are now correctly applied

Class: fix

limits to the number of active nodes are now applied more intuitively and consistent
with the WATO rule. This will also lead to a more reasonable behaviour of the check
in case of a cluster of two nodes with the default limits of (1,2): a warning level will
be set in there is one node, and a critical level if there are no nodes left.
