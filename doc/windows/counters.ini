2=System
3=The System performance object consists of counters that apply to more than one instance of a component processors on the computer.
4=Memory
5=The Memory performance object  consists of counters that describe the behavior of physical and virtual memory on the computer.  Physical memory is the amount of random access memory on the computer.  Virtual memory consists of the space in physical memory and on disk.  Many of the memory counters monitor paging, which is the movement of pages of code and data between disk and physical memory.  Excessive paging, a symptom of a memory shortage, can cause delays which interfere with all system processes.
6=% Processor Time
7=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends to execute a non-Idle thread. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of time that the processor spends executing the idle thread and then subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an idle thread that consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). This counter is the primary indicator of processor activity, and displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval. It should be noted that the accounting calculation of whether the processor is idle is performed at an internal sampling interval of the system clock (10ms). On todays fast processors, % Processor Time can therefore underestimate the processor utilization as the processor may be spending a lot of time servicing threads between the system clock sampling interval. Workload based timer applications are one example  of applications  which are more likely to be measured inaccurately as timers are signaled just after the sample is taken.
9=% Total DPC Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing deferred procedure calls (DPCs).  (DPCs are interrupts that run at a lower priority than the standard interrupts). It is the sum of Processor: % DPC Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total DPC Time is a component of System: % Total Privileged Time because DPCs are executed in privileged mode.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
10=File Read Operations/sec
11=File Read Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to read from the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of reads.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
12=File Write Operations/sec
13=File Write Operations/sec is the combined rate of the file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including requests to write to data in the file system cache.  It is measured in numbers of writes. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
14=File Control Operations/sec
15=File Control Operations/sec is the combined rate of file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, such as file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  This is the inverse of System: File Data Operations/sec and is measured in number of operations perf second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
16=File Read Bytes/sec
17=File Read Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are read to satisfy  file system read requests to all devices on the computer, including reads from the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
18=File Write Bytes/sec
19=File Write Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are written to satisfy file system write requests to all devices on the computer, including writes to the file system cache.  It is measured in number of bytes per second.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
20=File Control Bytes/sec
21=File Control Bytes/sec is the overall rate at which bytes are transferred for all file system operations that are neither reads nor writes, including file system control requests and requests for information about device characteristics or status.  It is measured in numbers of bytes.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
23=% Total Interrupt Time is the average percentage of time that all processors spend receiving and servicing hardware interrupts during sample intervals, where the value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts. It is the sum of Processor: % Interrupt Time for of all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  DPCs are counted separately and are not a component of the interrupt count.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices.
24=Available Bytes
25=Available Bytes is the amount of physical memory, in bytes, immediately available for allocation to a process or for system use. It is equal to the sum of memory assigned to the standby (cached), free and zero page lists. For a full explanation of the memory manager, refer to MSDN and/or the System Performance and Troubleshooting Guide chapter in the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit.
26=Committed Bytes
27=Committed Bytes is the amount of committed virtual memory, in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging file(s). There can be one or more paging files on each physical drive. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
28=Page Faults/sec
29=Page Faults/sec is the average number of pages faulted per second. It is measured in number of pages faulted per second because only one page is faulted in each fault operation, hence this is also equal to the number of page fault operations. This counter includes both hard faults (those that require disk access) and soft faults (where the faulted page is found elsewhere in physical memory.) Most processors can handle large numbers of soft faults without significant consequence. However, hard faults, which require disk access, can cause significant delays.
30=Commit Limit
31=Commit Limit is the amount of virtual memory that can be committed without having to extend the paging file(s).  It is measured in bytes. Committed memory is the physical memory which has space reserved on the disk paging files. There can be one paging file on each logical drive). If the paging file(s) are be expanded, this limit increases accordingly.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
32=Write Copies/sec
33=Write Copies/sec is the rate at which page faults are caused by attempts to write that have been satisfied by coping of the page from elsewhere in physical memory. This is an economical way of sharing data since pages are only copied when they are written to; otherwise, the page is shared. This counter shows the number of copies, without regard for the number of pages copied in each operation.
34=Transition Faults/sec
35=Transition Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults are resolved by recovering pages that were being used by another process sharing the page, or were on the modified page list or the standby list, or were being written to disk at the time of the page fault. The pages were recovered without additional disk activity. Transition faults are counted in numbers of faults; because only one page is faulted in each operation, it is also equal to the number of pages faulted.
36=Cache Faults/sec
37=Cache Faults/sec is the rate at which faults occur when a page sought in the file system cache is not found and must be retrieved from elsewhere in memory (a soft fault) or from disk (a hard fault). The file system cache is an area of physical memory that stores recently used pages of data for applications. Cache activity is a reliable indicator of most application I/O operations. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard for the number of pages faulted in each operation.
38=Demand Zero Faults/sec
39=Demand Zero Faults/sec is the rate at which a zeroed page is required to satisfy the fault.  Zeroed pages, pages emptied of previously stored data and filled with zeros, are a security feature of Windows that prevent processes from seeing data stored by earlier processes that used the memory space. Windows maintains a list of zeroed pages to accelerate this process. This counter shows the number of faults, without regard to the number of pages retrieved to satisfy the fault. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
40=Pages/sec
41=Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays.  It is the sum of Memory\\Pages Input/sec and Memory\\Pages Output/sec.  It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such as Memory\\Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files.
42=Page Reads/sec
43=Page Reads/sec is the rate at which the disk was read to resolve hard page faults. It shows the number of reads operations, without regard to the number of pages retrieved in each operation. Hard page faults occur when a process references a page in virtual memory that is not in working set or elsewhere in physical memory, and must be retrieved from disk. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It includes read operations to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) and in non-cached mapped memory files. Compare the value of Memory\\Pages Reads/sec to the value of Memory\\Pages Input/sec to determine the average number of pages read during each operation.
44=Processor Queue Length
45=Processor Queue Length is the number of threads in the processor queue.  Unlike the disk counters, this counter counters, this counter shows ready threads only, not threads that are running.  There is a single queue for processor time even on computers with multiple processors. Therefore, if a computer has multiple processors, you need to divide this value by the number of processors servicing the workload. A sustained processor queue of less than 10 threads per processor is normally acceptable, dependent of the workload.
46=Thread State
47=Thread State is the current state of the thread.  It is 0 for Initialized, 1 for Ready, 2 for Running, 3 for Standby, 4 for Terminated, 5 for Wait, 6 for Transition, 7 for Unknown.  A Running thread is using a processor; a Standby thread is about to use one.  A Ready thread wants to use a processor, but is waiting for a processor because none are free.  A thread in Transition is waiting for a resource in order to execute, such as waiting for its execution stack to be paged in from disk.  A Waiting thread has no use for the processor because it is waiting for a peripheral operation to complete or a resource to become free.
48=Pages Output/sec
49=Pages Output/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written back to disk only if they are changed in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code. A high rate of pages output might indicate a memory shortage. Windows writes more pages back to disk to free up space when physical memory is in short supply.  This counter shows the number of pages, and can be compared to other counts of pages, without conversion.
50=Page Writes/sec
51=Page Writes/sec is the rate at which pages are written to disk to free up space in physical memory. Pages are written to disk only if they are changed while in physical memory, so they are likely to hold data, not code.  This counter shows write operations, without regard to the number of pages written in each operation.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
52=Browser
53=The Browser performance object consists of counters that measure the rates of announcements, enumerations, and other Browser transmissions.
54=Announcements Server/sec
55=Announcements Server/sec is the rate at which the servers in this domain have announced themselves to this server.
56=Pool Paged Bytes
57=Pool Paged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the paged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used.  Memory\\Pool Paged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Paged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Paged Bytes\\_Total. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
58=Pool Nonpaged Bytes
59=Pool Nonpaged Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the nonpaged pool, an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that cannot be written to disk, but must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.  Memory\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes is calculated differently than Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes, so it might not equal Process\\Pool Nonpaged Bytes\\_Total.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
60=Pool Paged Allocs
61=Pool Paged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. It is measured in numbers of calls to allocate space, regardless of the amount of space allocated in each call.  This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
63=Pool Paged Resident Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the paged pool. The paged pool is an area of system memory (physical memory used by the operating system) for objects that can be written to disk when they are not being used. Space used by the paged and nonpaged pools are taken from physical memory, so a pool that is too large denies memory space to processes. This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
64=Pool Nonpaged Allocs
65=Pool Nonpaged Allocs is the number of calls to allocate space in the nonpaged pool. The nonpaged pool is an area of system memory area for objects that cannot be written to disk, and must remain in physical memory as long as they are allocated.

This counter displays the last observed value only; it is not an average.
74=System Driver Resident Bytes
75=System Driver Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable physical memory being used by device drivers. It is the working set (physical memory area) of the drivers.

Neither Memory\\System Driver Resident Bytes nor Memory\\System Driver Total Bytes includes memory that cannot be written to disk.
76=System Cache Resident Bytes
77=System Cache Resident Bytes is the size, in bytes, of the pageable operating system code in the file system cache. This value includes only current physical pages and does not include any virtual memory pages not currently resident. It does equal the System Cache value shown in Task Manager. As a result, this value may be smaller than the actual amount of virtual memory in use by the file system cache. This value is a component of Memory\\System Code Resident Bytes which represents all pageable operating system code that is currently in physical memory.

The LAN Redirector uses this method for retrieving information from the cache, as does the LAN Server for small transfers.  This is a method used by the disk file systems as well.
114=MDL Reads/sec
115=MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the data.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page involved in the transfer, and thus can employ a hardware Direct Memory Access (DMA) device to effect the copy.  The LAN Server uses this method for large transfers out of the server.
116=Sync MDL Reads/sec
117=Sync MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.  If the accessed page(s) are not in main memory, the caller will wait for the pages to fault in from the disk.
118=Async MDL Reads/sec
119=Async MDL Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that use a Memory Descriptor List (MDL) to access the pages.  The MDL contains the physical address of each page in the transfer, thus permitting Direct Memory Access (DMA) of the pages.

124=Fast Reads/sec
125=Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.
126=Sync Fast Reads/sec
127=Sync Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits direct retrieval of data from the cache without file system involvement if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.  If the data is not in the cache, the request (application program call) will wait until the data has been retrieved from disk.
128=Async Fast Reads/sec
129=Async Fast Reads/sec is the frequency of reads from the file system cache that bypass the installed file system and retrieve the data directly from the cache.  Normally, file I/O requests will invoke the appropriate file system to retrieve data from a file, but this path permits data to be retrieved from the cache directly (without file system involvement) if the data is in the cache.  Even if the data is not in the cache, one invocation of the file system is avoided.

134=Lazy Write Flushes/sec
135=Lazy Write Flushes/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.  Lazy Writing is the process of updating the disk after the page has been changed in memory, so that the application that changed the file does not have to wait for the disk write to be complete before proceeding.  More than one page can be transferred by each write operation.
136=Lazy Write Pages/sec
137=Lazy Write Pages/sec is the rate at which the Lazy Writer thread has written to disk.

142=% User Time
143=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time the processor spends in the user mode. User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services. This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
144=% Privileged Time
145=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
146=Context Switches/sec
147=Context Switches/sec is the combined rate at which all processors on the computer are switched from one thread to another.  Context switches occur when a running thread voluntarily relinquishes the processor, is preempted by a higher priority ready thread, or switches between user-mode and privileged (kernel) mode to use an Executive or subsystem service.  It is the sum of Thread\\Context Switches/sec for all threads running on all processors in the computer and is measured in numbers of switches.  There are context switch counters on the System and Thread objects. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
148=Interrupts/sec
149=Interrupts/sec is the average rate, in incidents per second, at which the processor received and serviced hardware interrupts. It does not include deferred procedure calls (DPCs), which are counted separately. This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system clock, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards, and other peripheral devices. These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention. Normal thread execution is suspended. The system clock typically interrupts the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
150=System Calls/sec
151=System Calls/sec is the combined rate of calls to operating system service routines by all processes running on the computer.

This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
152=Level 1 TLB Fills/sec
153=Level 1 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
154=Level 2 TLB Fills/sec
155=Level 2 TLB Fills/sec is the frequency of faults that occur when reference is made to memory whose Page Table Entry (PTE) is not in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB), nor is the page containing the PTE.  On some computers this fault is handled by software loading the PTE into the TLB, and this counter is incremented.
156=Enumerations Server/sec
157=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in user mode. Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode. Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows executive, kernel, and device drivers. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
158=Enumerations Domain/sec
159=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode. When a Windows system service is called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.

172=Virtual Bytes Peak
173=Virtual Bytes Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of virtual address space the process has used at any one time. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. However, virtual space is finite, and the process might limit its ability to load libraries.
174=Virtual Bytes
175=Virtual Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of the virtual address space the process is using. Use of virtual address space does not necessarily imply corresponding use of either disk or main memory pages. Virtual space is finite, and the process can limit its ability to load libraries.
177=Page Faults/sec is the rate at which page faults by the threads executing in this process are occurring.  A page fault occurs when a thread refers to a virtual memory page that is not in its working set in main memory. This may not cause the page to be fetched from disk if it is on the standby list and hence already in main memory, or if it is in use by another process with whom the page is shared.
178=Working Set Peak
179=Working Set Peak is the maximum size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process at any point in time. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use. When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before they leave main memory.
180=Working Set
181=Working Set is the current size, in bytes, of the Working Set of this process. The Working Set is the set of memory pages touched recently by the threads in the process. If free memory in the computer is above a threshold, pages are left in the Working Set of a process even if they are not in use.  When free memory falls below a threshold, pages are trimmed from Working Sets. If they are needed they will then be soft-faulted back into the Working Set before leaving main memory.
182=Page File Bytes Peak
183=Page File Bytes Peak is the maximum amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this process has reserved for use in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files.  Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory. If there is no paging file, this counter reflects the maximum amount of virtual memory that the process has reserved for use in physical memory.
184=Page File Bytes
185=Page File Bytes is the current amount of virtual memory, in bytes, that this process has reserved for use in the paging file(s). Paging files are used to store pages of memory used by the process that are not contained in other files. Paging files are shared by all processes, and the lack of space in paging files can prevent other processes from allocating memory. If there is no paging file, this counter reflects the current amount of virtual memory that the process has reserved for use in physical memory.
186=Private Bytes
187=Private Bytes is the current size, in bytes, of memory that this process has allocated that cannot be shared with other processes.
188=Announcements Total/sec
189=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
190=Enumerations Total/sec
191=% Processor Time is the percentage of elapsed time that all of process threads used the processor to execution instructions. An instruction is the basic unit of execution in a computer, a thread is the object that executes instructions, and a process is the object created when a program is run. Code executed to handle some hardware interrupts and trap conditions are included in this count.
193=% User Time is the percentage of elapsed time that this thread has spent executing code in user mode.  Applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems execute in user mode.  Code executing in user mode cannot damage the integrity of the Windows NT Executive, Kernel, and device drivers.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of your application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in your process.
195=% Privileged Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the process threads spent executing code in privileged mode.  When a Windows system service in called, the service will often run in privileged mode to gain access to system-private data. Such data is protected from access by threads executing in user mode. Calls to the system can be explicit or implicit, such as page faults or interrupts. Unlike some early operating systems, Windows uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes. Some work done by Windows on behalf of the application might appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the process.
197=Context Switches/sec is the rate of switches from one thread to another.  Thread switches can occur either inside of a single process or across processes.  A thread switch can be caused either by one thread asking another for information, or by a thread being preempted by another, higher priority thread becoming ready to run.  Unlike some early operating systems, Windows NT uses process boundaries for subsystem protection in addition to the traditional protection of user and privileged modes.  These subsystem processes provide additional protection.  Therefore, some work done by Windows NT on behalf of an application  appear in other subsystem processes in addition to the privileged time in the application.  Switching to the subsystem process causes one Context Switch in the application thread.  Switching back causes another Context Switch in the subsystem thread.
198=Current Disk Queue Length
199=Current Disk Queue Length is the number of requests outstanding on the disk at the time the performance data is collected. It also includes requests in service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot, not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests experience delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference should average less than two.
200=% Disk Time
201=% Disk Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the selected disk drive was busy servicing read or write requests.

232=Thread
233=The Thread performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of thread behavior.  A thread is the basic object that executes instructions on a processor.  All running processes have at least one thread.
234=PhysicalDisk
235=The Physical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor hard or fixed disk drive on a computer.  Disks are used to store file, program, and paging data and are read to retrieve these items, and written to record changes to them.  The values of physical disk counters are sums of the values of the logical disks (or partitions) into which they are divided.
236=LogicalDisk
237=The Logical Disk performance object consists of counters that monitor logical partitions of a hard or fixed disk drives.  Performance Monitor identifies logical disks by their a drive letter, such as C.
238=Processor
239=The Processor performance object consists of counters that measure aspects of processor activity. The processor is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical computations, initiates operations on peripherals, and runs the threads of processes.  A computer can have multiple processors.  The processor object represents each processor as an instance of the object.
240=% Total Processor Time
241=% Total Processor Time is the average percentage of time that all processors on the computer are executing non-idle threads.   This counter was designed as the primary indicator of processor activity on multiprocessor computers.  It is equal to the sum of Process: % Processor Time for all processors, divided by the number of processors.  It is calculated by summing the time that all processors spend executing the thread of the Idle process in each sample interval, subtracting that value from 100%, and dividing the difference by the number of processors on the computer.  (Each processor has an Idle thread which consumes cycles when no other threads are ready to run). For example, on a multiprocessor computer, a value of 50% means that all processors are busy for half of the sample interval, or that half of the processors are busy for all of the sample interval.  This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval.  It is calculated by monitoring the time the service was inactive, and then subtracting that value from 100%.
242=% Total User Time
243=% Total User Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in user mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % User Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (User mode is a restricted processing mode designed for applications, environment subsystems, and integral subsystems.  The alternative, privileged mode, is designed for operating system components and allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
244=% Total Privileged Time
245=% Total Privileged Time is the average percentage of non-idle time all processors spend in privileged (kernel) mode.  It is the sum of Processor: % Privileged Time for all processors on the computer, divided by the number of processors.  System: % Total User Time and System: % Total Privileged Time sum to % Total Processor Time, but not always to 100%.  (Privileged mode is an processing mode designed for operating system components which allows direct access to hardware and all memory.  The operating system switches application threads to privileged mode to access operating system services.  The alternative, user mode, is a restricted processing mode designed for applications and environment subsystems). This counter displays the average busy time as a percentage of the sample time.
246=Total Interrupts/sec
247=Total Interrupts/sec is the combined rate of hardware interrupts received and serviced by all processors on the computer It is the sum of Processor: Interrupts/sec for all processors, and divided by the number of processors, and is measured in numbers of interrupts.  It does not include DPCs, which are counted separately.  This value is an indirect indicator of the activity of devices that generate interrupts, such as the system timer, the mouse, disk drivers, data communication lines, network interface cards and other peripheral devices.  These devices normally interrupt the processor when they have completed a task or require attention.  Normal thread execution is suspended during interrupts.  Most system clocks interrupt the processor every 10 milliseconds, creating a background of interrupt activity.  This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples, divided by the duration of the sample interval.
248=Processes
249=Processes is the number of processes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Each process represents the running of a program.

254=Semaphores
255=Semaphores is the number of semaphores in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Threads use semaphores to obtain exclusive access to data structures that they share with other threads.
256=Mutexes
257=Mutexes counts the number of mutexes in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  Mutexes are used by threads to assure only one thread is executing a particular section of code.
258=Sections
259=Sections is the number of sections in the computer at the time of data collection. This is an instantaneous count, not an average over the time interval.  A section is a portion of virtual memory created by a process for storing data. A process can share sections with other processes.
260=Objects
261=The Object performance object consists of counters that monitor  logical objects in the system, such as processes, threads, mutexes, and semaphores.  This information can be used to detect the unnecessary consumption of computer resources.  Each object requires memory to store basic information about the object.

263=The Redirector performance object consists of counter that monitor network connections originating at the local computer.
264=Bytes Received/sec
265=Bytes Received/sec is the rate of bytes coming in to the Redirector from the network.  It includes all application data as well as network protocol information (such as packet headers).
266=Packets Received/sec
267=Packets Received/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is receiving packets (also called SMBs or Server Message Blocks).  Network transmissions are divided into packets.  The average number of bytes received in a packet can be obtained by dividing Bytes Received/sec by this counter.  Some packets received might not contain incoming data (for example an acknowledgment to a write made by the Redirector would count as an incoming packet).
268=Read Bytes Paging/sec
269=Read Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to read bytes in response to page faults.  Page faults are caused by loading of modules (such as programs and libraries), by a miss in the Cache (see Read Bytes Cache/sec), or by files directly mapped into the address space of applications (a high-performance feature of Windows NT).
270=Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec
271=Read Bytes Non-Paging/sec are those bytes read by the Redirector in response to normal file requests by an application when they are redirected to come from another computer.  In addition to file requests, this counter includes other methods of reading across the network such as Named Pipes and Transactions.  This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
272=Read Bytes Cache/sec
273=Read Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications are accessing the file system cache by using the Redirector.  Some of these data requests are satisfied by retrieving the data from the cache.  Requests that miss the Cache cause a page fault (see Read Bytes Paging/sec).
274=Read Bytes Network/sec
275=Read Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are reading data across the network. This occurs when data sought in the file system cache is not found there and must be retrieved from the network.  Dividing this value by Bytes Received/sec indicates the proportion of application data traveling across the network. (see Bytes Received/sec).
276=Bytes Transmitted/sec

281=Write Bytes Paging/sec is the rate at which the Redirector is attempting to write bytes changed in the pages being used by applications.  The program data changed by modules (such as programs and libraries) that were loaded over the network are 'paged out' when no longer needed.  Other output pages come from the file system cache (see Write Bytes Cache/sec).
282=Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec
283=Write Bytes Non-Paging/sec is the rate at which bytes are written by the Redirector in response to normal file outputs by an application when they are redirected to another computer.

This counter does not count network protocol information, just application data.
284=Write Bytes Cache/sec
285=Write Bytes Cache/sec is the rate at which applications on your computer are writing to the file system cache by using the Redirector.  The data might not leave your computer immediately; it can be retained in the cache for further modification before being written to the network.  This saves network traffic.  Each write of a byte into the cache is counted here.
286=Write Bytes Network/sec
287=Write Bytes Network/sec is the rate at which applications are writing data across the network. This occurs when the file system cache is bypassed, such as for Named Pipes or Transactions, or when the cache writes the bytes to disk to make room for other data.  Dividing this counter by Bytes Transmitted/sec will indicate the proportion of application data being to the network (see Transmitted Bytes/sec).
288=Read Operations/sec
289=File Read Operations/sec is the rate at which applications are asking the Redirector for data. Each call to a file system or similar Application Program Interface (API) call counts as one operation.

292=Read Packets/sec
293=Read Packets/sec is the rate at which read packets are being placed on the network.  Each time a single packet is sent with a request to read data remotely, this counter is incremented by one.
294=Reads Large/sec

306=Write Packets Small/sec
307=Write Packets Small/sec is the rate at which writes are made by applications that are less than one-fourth of the server's negotiated buffer size.  Too many of these could indicate a waste of buffers on the server.  This counter is incremented once for each write: it counts writes, not packets.
308=Reads Denied/sec
309=Reads Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Reads.  When a read is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Read which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
310=Writes Denied/sec
311=Writes Denied/sec is the rate at which the server is unable to accommodate requests for Raw Writes.  When a write is much larger than the server's negotiated buffer size, the Redirector requests a Raw Write which, if granted, would permit the transfer of the data without lots of protocol overhead on each packet.  To accomplish this the server must lock out other requests, so the request is denied if the server is really busy.
312=Network Errors/sec
313=Network Errors/sec is the rate at which serious unexpected errors are occurring. Such errors generally indicate that the Redirector and one or more Servers are having serious communication difficulties. For example an SMB (Server Manager Block) protocol error is a Network Error. An entry is written to the System Event Log and provide details.
314=Server Sessions
315=Server Sessions counts the total number of security objects the Redirector has managed.  For example, a logon to a server followed by a network access to the same server will establish one connection, but two sessions.
316=Server Reconnects
317=Server Reconnects counts the number of times your Redirector has had to reconnect to a server in order to complete a new active request.  You can be disconnected by the Server if you remain inactive for too long.  Locally even if all your remote files are closed, the Redirector will keep your connections intact for (nominally) ten minutes.  Such inactive connections are called Dormant Connections.  Reconnecting is expensive in time.

3520=Database Page Faults/sec
3521=Database Page Faults/sec is the rate that database file page requests require the database cache manager to allocate a new page from the database cache.
3522=Database Page Evictions/sec
3523=Database Page Evictions/sec is the rate that database file page requests that require the database cache manager to allocate a new page from the database cache force another database page out of the cache.  The eviction count is charged when the page is allocated and not when the previous owner of that page was actually evicted from the cache.  If this rate is too high, the database cache size may be too small.
3524=Database Page Fault Stalls/sec
3525=Database Page Fault Stalls/sec is the rate of page faults that cannot be serviced because there are no pages available for allocation from the database cache.  If this counter is non-zero most of the time, the clean threshold may be too low.
3526=Database Cache Size (MB)
3527=Database Cache Size (MB) is the amount of system memory (in MegaBytes) used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.  If the database cache size seems to be too small for optimal performance and there is very little available memory on the system (see Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance.  If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.  Increasing this limit may increase performance.
3528=Database Cache Size
3529=Database Cache Size is the amount of system memory used by the database cache manager to hold commonly used information from the database file(s) to prevent file operations.  If the database cache size seems to be too small for optimal performance and there is very little available memory on the system (see Memory/Available Bytes), adding more memory to the system may increase performance.  If there is a lot of available memory on the system and the database cache size is not growing beyond a certain point, the database cache size may be capped at an artificially low limit.

The database cache will recover from this event but if this is a common occurrence then it can lead to significant performance problems.
3536=Database Cache Size Resident (MB)
3537=Database Cache Size Resident (MB) is the amount of system memory (in MegaBytes) used by the database cache that is currently part of the working set of the process.  If Database Cache Size Resident (MB) is ever significantly smaller than Database Cache Size (MB) then the operating system has chosen to reclaim that system memory for use in other parts of the system.  The database cache will recover from this event but if this is a common occurrence then it can lead to significant performance problems.
3538=Database Cache % Available Min
3539=Database Cache % Available Min is the minimum percentage of the database cache that is kept to be allocated to cache database pages that are newly created or read in from the database file(s).  If the percentage of available pages drops below this minimum, pages are thrown out of the database cache until the maximum percentage of available pages is reached.  This percentage should be set as low as possible without causing the actual percentage to drop to zero, causing cache fault stalls.  [Dev Only]

5042=.NET CLR Memory
5043=Counters for CLR Garbage Collected heap.
5044=# Gen 0 Collections
5045=This counter displays the number of times the generation 0 objects (youngest; most recently allocated) are garbage collected (Gen 0 GC) since the start of the application. Gen 0 GC occurs when the available memory in generation 0 is not sufficient to satisfy an allocation request. This counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 0 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 1 or Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5046=# Gen 1 Collections
5047=This counter displays the number of times the generation 1 objects are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 1 GC. Higher generation GCs include all lower generation GCs. This counter is explicitly incremented when a higher generation (Gen 2) GC occurs. _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5048=# Gen 2 Collections
5049=This counter displays the number of times the generation 2 objects (older) are garbage collected since the start of the application. The counter is incremented at the end of a Gen 2 GC (also called full GC). _Global_ counter value is not accurate and should be ignored. This counter displays the last observed value.
5050=Promoted Memory from Gen 0
5051=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter.
5052=Promoted Memory from Gen 1
5053=This counter displays the bytes of memory that survive garbage collection (GC) and are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter. This counter is reset to 0 if the last GC was a Gen 0 GC only.
5054=Gen 0 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5055=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 0 (youngest) to generation 1; objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. This counter was designed as an indicator of relatively long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5056=Gen 1 Promoted Bytes/Sec
5057=This counter displays the bytes per second that are promoted from generation 1 to generation 2 (oldest); objects that are promoted just because they are waiting to be finalized are not included in this counter. Memory is promoted when it survives a garbage collection. Nothing is promoted from generation 2 since it is the oldest. This counter was designed as an indicator of very long-lived objects being created per sec. This counter displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5058=Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0
5059=This counter displays the bytes of memory that are promoted from generation 0 to generation 1 just because they are waiting to be finalized. This counter displays the value observed at the end of the last GC; its not a cumulative counter.

5061=This counter displays the process ID of the CLR process instance being monitored.
5062=Gen 0 heap size
5063=This counter displays the maximum bytes that can be allocated in generation 0 (Gen 0); its does not indicate the current number of bytes allocated in Gen 0. A Gen 0 GC is triggered when the allocations since the last GC exceed this size. The Gen 0 size is tuned by the Garbage Collector and can change during the execution of the application. At the end of a Gen 0 collection the size of the Gen 0 heap is infact 0 bytes; this counter displays the size (in bytes) of allocations that would trigger the next Gen 0 GC. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5064=Gen 1 heap size
5065=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 1 (Gen 1); this counter does not display the maximum size of Gen 1. Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from previous Gen 0 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5066=Gen 2 heap size
5067=This counter displays the current number of bytes in generation 2 (Gen 2). Objects are not directly allocated in this generation; they are promoted from Gen 1 during previous Gen 1 GCs. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5068=Large Object Heap size
5069=This counter displays the current size of the Large Object Heap in bytes. Objects greater than 20 KBytes are treated as large objects by the Garbage Collector and are directly allocated in a special heap; they are not promoted through the generations. This counter is updated at the end of a GC; its not updated on every allocation.
5070=Finalization Survivors
5071=This counter displays the number of garbage collected objects that survive a collection because they are waiting to be finalized. If these objects hold references to other objects then those objects also survive but are not counted by this counter; the "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 0" and "Promoted Finalization-Memory from Gen 1" counters represent all the memory that survived due to finalization. This counter is not a cumulative counter; its updated at the end of every GC with count of the survivors during that particular GC only. This counter was designed to indicate the extra overhead that the application might incur because of finalization.
5072=# GC Handles
5073=This counter displays the current number of GC Handles in use. GCHandles are handles to resources external to the CLR and the managed environment. Handles occupy small amounts of memory in the GCHeap but potentially expensive unmanaged resources.
5074=Allocated Bytes/sec
5075=This counter displays the rate of bytes per second allocated on the GC Heap. This counter is updated at the end of every GC; not at each allocation. This counter is not an average over time; it displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval.
5076=# Induced GC
5077=This counter displays the peak number of times a garbage collection was performed because of an explicit call to GC.Collect. Its a good practice to let the GC tune the frequency of its collections.
5078=% Time in GC
5079=% Time in GC is the percentage of elapsed time that was spent in performing a garbage collection (GC) since the last GC cycle. This counter is usually an indicator of the work done by the Garbage Collector on behalf of the application to collect and compact memory. This counter is updated only at the end of every GC and the counter value reflects the last observed value; its not an average.
5080=Not Displayed
5081=Not Displayed.
5082=# Bytes in all Heaps
5083=This counter is the sum of four other counters; Gen 0 Heap Size; Gen 1 Heap Size; Gen 2 Heap Size and the Large Object Heap Size. This counter indicates the current memory allocated in bytes on the GC Heaps.
5084=# Total committed Bytes
5085=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently committed by the Garbage Collector. (Committed memory is the physical memory for which space has been reserved on the disk paging file).
5086=# Total reserved Bytes
5087=This counter displays the amount of virtual memory (in bytes) currently reserved by the Garbage Collector. (Reserved memory is the virtual memory space reserved for the application but no disk or main memory pages have been used.)
5088=# of Pinned Objects
5089=This counter displays the number of pinned objects encountered in the last GC. This counter tracks the pinned objects only in the heaps that were garbage collected e.g. a Gen 0 GC would cause enumeration of pinned objects in the generation 0 heap only. A pinned object is one that the Garbage Collector cannot move in memory.
5090=# of Sink Blocks in use
5091=This counter displays the current number of sync blocks in use. Sync blocks are per-object data structures allocated for storing synchronization information. Sync blocks hold weak references to managed objects and need to be scanned by the Garbage Collector. Sync blocks are not limited to storing synchronization information and can also store COM interop metadata. This counter was designed to indicate performance problems with heavy use of synchronization primitives.
