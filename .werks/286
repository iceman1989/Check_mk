Title: esx_vsphrere_counters.ramdisk: Better handling for non existant ramdisks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385621928
Class: fix

We sadly do not get the total ramdisk sizes from the ESX host, so we need to assume
that equal named ramdisks on the ESX hosts are all of the same size. The known
disks are configured in the check.

In the past, all ramdisks changed to <tt>UNKNOWN</tt>, once at least one ramdisk
was not known to the check. This has been changed now, to show only the not handled
ramdisk as UNKNOWN.
