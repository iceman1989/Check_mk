title: 3COM and H3C switches: CPU utilization
agents: snmp
catalog: hw/network/h3c
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This Check queries the CPU utilization of various LAN switches that are
 supporting the MIB for H3C lan switches.  These are: newer 3COM switches
 (Superstack 4 and later), H3C branded switches and now for example the HP
 "A-Series" Networking gear. The same switches from the original maker Huawei
 are {not} supporting the MIB.  The check tries to correctly label the CPU in
 your switch / stack / core switch module slots.

 The check goes WARN/CRIT if the average CPU usage of the last {five minutes}
 exceeds configurable levels.

 Note that some of these switches don't handle SNMP well and might generate
 up to 90% cpu load while queried.  To accomodate for this you should lower
 the frequency of SNMP based checks with them.

 Some devices have a high usage even in normal conditions (i.e. running full
 BGP tables). In that case you might have to fine tune the check parameters
 or even have to disable the check.

inventory:
 The check will create one separate service per CPU.

item:
 A string describing the switch and unit number, for example {"Switch 2 CPU 0"}
 or {"Switch 1 Slot 11"}.

perfdata:
 One value: the 5 minute average CPU usage in percent (from 0 to 100).

[parameters]
warning (int): the percentage of 5-minute average usage at which the check returns WARN.
critical (int): the percentage of 5-minute average usage at which the check goes critical.

[configuration]
switch_cpu_default_levels (int, int): the default warn and critical levels.
 They are preset to {(50,75)} (meaning 50% for WARN and 75% for CRIT).
