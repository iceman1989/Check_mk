Title: Add directory local/share/check_mk/mibs
Component: core
Class: nastiness
State: done

Targetversion: future

The option --snmptranslate allows to install SNMP MIBs in that
directory. In non-OMD-Situtations another directory is being
used. Setup/OMD should make sure that those directories always
exist.
