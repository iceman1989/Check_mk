Class: feature

A display option for choosing the time range to be shown in the searched graphs
has been added to the Graph Search view. This option can be used to specify custom
time ranges, either relative or absolute date/time specifications.

Additionally you can also use the former existing PNP view option to choose the
level of detail (RRAs / views).
