Title: windows agent: now also available as msi installer
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1405075357
Class: feature

The new msi install check_mk_agent.msi packages contains the 32 and 64 bit version of the check_mk_agent.exe.
Upon install the msi package will determine the os architecture and install the matching agent accordingly.
The installed 32/64 Bit Agent is always named check_mk_agent.exe.

Note: The msi installer always installs into the 32 bit program files folder. This is by design.
