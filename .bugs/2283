Title: logwatch: log entries with braces in names can not be shown in logwatch GUI
Component: multisite
State: open
Date: 2014-12-12 17:21:28
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1
Class: bug

Braces are not removed from logwatch stored files. Logwatch-GUI does not handle this difference correctly.
e.g. mk_sap creates such logwatch files
