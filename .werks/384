In some situation, when restarting the mkeventd, the old process has
been stopped, but when the new process comes up, the builtin syslog
server can not open the port, because it is somehow still opened.
The error message is:

Cannot bind TCP socket for syslog-tcp to port: Address already in use

This change tries to prevent the problem.
