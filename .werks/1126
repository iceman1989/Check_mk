Title: bluecat_ntp: check no longer crashes on evaluating sysLeap values higher than 1
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1413379702
Class: fix

The oid sysLeap is specificied as bitfield.
The 4 possible values are reported as

<ul>
<li>0: no warning</li>
<li>1: add second</li>
<li>10: subtract second</li>
<li>11: Alarm</li>
</ul>
<br>

The previous implementation was incorrected, because it expected the numbers 0-3.
