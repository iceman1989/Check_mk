Title: livedump: Added optional check interval (detect staleness) / option to encrypt mails
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1406706675
Class: feature

Added a new option "-i" to livedump to make the check_interval of the hosts / services
configurable. When this is set the staleness detection on the destination system works.

Added option to use AES encrypted messages with livedump-mail-fetch. Added a short
documentation to the livedump README for details.
