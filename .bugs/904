Title: Support event processing (eg cancelling) after rewriting
Component: ec
State: open
Date: 2013-04-02 11:48:32
Targetversion: future
Class: feature

From old ticketing system #371246:

We've located the issue. It seems like canceling events doesn't work with
rewriting. We're sending SNMP traps from a backup server with status for
each host, the received hostname in EC is the backup server and we're
rewriting to the correct hostname for each backup job.

When we receive the expected regular message, as a canceling event, the
rewrite is not performed, and the previous critical event is not
canceled.

[1362647115.920606] Do not cancel event 3613: host is not the same (vmtxm01qa != vmnag01qa)

Bug / Feature request?

Hello,

this is a missing informationen in our documentation.

The processing of events is befor the rewriting. This behavior isnt easy to change.

----------------------------------

Ok. An easier approach could be to make it possible to disable the host
check in the "Matching criteria" for "cancel event"?

We've commented out the check in the code. And we now have functional
backup monitoring. I guess there will be others with similar
requirements.
