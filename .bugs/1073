Title: Chrome: help switches on randomly

The online help sometimes randomly switches on on Chrome on Windows.
Never seen this on Firefox. Seems like the help.mk in the user profile
correctly corresponds to the settings, so there it is no javascript problem?

This seems hard to reproduce. We can use Chrome for a while...

It was caused by setting the option before having the user context.
