Title: Make NTP check more tolerant
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: future
Class: nastiness

The message "CRIT - found 1 peers, but none is suitable" should be tolerated for
at least some time. Maybe the check could itself measure how long that state
is active and raise a MKCounterWrapped for an intermediate time...
