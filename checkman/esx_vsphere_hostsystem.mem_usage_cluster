title: VMware ESX vCenter: Total physical RAM usage of clustered ESX hosts
agents: vsphere
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the total physical RAM usage for a cluster of hosts.
 This check is only applicable for clusters and cannot be inventorized.
 You need to create a manual check for it in WATO and assign it to a cluster host.

examples:
 static_checks['mem_cluster'] = [
   ( ('esx_vsphere_hostsystem.mem_usage_cluster', None,
    [(2, (60.0, 70.0)),
     (5, (70.0, 80.0)),
     (7, (85.0, 90.0))
    ]), [], ['esx_cluster'] ),
 ] + static_checks['mem_cluster']



inventory:
 Not applicable

perfdata:
 One value: the current total usage in bytes.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): A list of tuples where you can define the number of
 minimum required nodes and the corresponding levels.

OneElement Tuple: number_of_nodes(int), (WARN(float), CRIT(float))

 Please refer example.
