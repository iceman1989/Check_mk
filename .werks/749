Title: Allow to restrict visibility of events by their host contacts
Level: 2
Component: ec

Class: feature

The Event Console has now two new permissions:

<ol>
<li>See all events</li>
<li>See events not related to a known host</li>
</ol>

Both permissions default to <i>yes</i> in all roles. If you remove the <i>See all events</i>
permission then a user can only see events for hosts that either he is a monitoring contact for
or that are not known to the monitoring at all (i.e. no host with such a name or IP address
is configured as monitored host in your monitoring core). The visibility of the later
ones can be switched off with the second permission. The second permission is only relevant
if <i>See all events</i> is set to <i>no</i> - of course.

Furthermore you can now assign <i>Fallback Contact Groups</i> to an event. This
is done with a new rule option in the section <i>Outcome &amp; Action</i>. As
soon as you assign contact groups these will be assumed for all hosts
that are not in the monitoring. That groups will be attached as an additional information
to each event created with that rule. These events will then be handled like as if the
host is known to the monitoring when it comes to the visibility.
