Title: mismatch between check and check manpages for plugin sap
Component: checks
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-10-04 12:34:09
Targetversion: 1.2.3i3

the sap checks provide perfdata
but the manpages sap.dialog and sap.value tell, it does not

perfdata need to be documented in the both manpages

Done.
