The ps check for Linux and Windows needs to be completely reworked.
We need to write a real parse function using dicts that create a
useful common structure for Linux and Windows and then remove lots
of nasty special handlings.

For Linux we need the content of /proc/[pid]/stat in order to
correctly determine the CPU utilization. This can be done at
this time - not further.

Here is a suggested command line for the agent:

echo '[proc_stat]'
echo /proc/[0-9]*/stat | xargs awk '{ print $1 " " $14 " " $15; }' 2>/dev/null
echo '[proc_stat_end]'

We might user further data from here and throw that away from the
current bracket code.

In order not to break compatibility we could implement a new section
and a new check and the deprecate the existing one.
