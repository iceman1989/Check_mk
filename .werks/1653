Title: megaraid_pdisks: Resulting states are now hard coded within the check
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417709673
Class: fix

The megaraid_pdisks check was using the state the device had during initial
inventory as expected OK state. When a device was failed during inventory,
the state never changed to CRITICAL, even if the device is failed.
This has been fixed by hard coding the resulting states now.

Online, Hotspare -> OK
Failed -> CRITICAL
