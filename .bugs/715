Title: WATO permission "edit views" = False disables display of custom views
Component: wato
State: done
Date: 2012-07-06 14:16:42
Targetversion: 1.2.2
Class: bug

if a user is restricted of the rights to edit/create views of his own, he'll
also not be able to see any views that you put in his views.mk It should be
possible to still use that were "installed" on setup.

Resolution: we simply rename the permission into "Allow creating and using
own customized views"
