Class: feature

Thew new rule set <i>Alternative display name for Services</i> allows you
to specify an alternative name to be displayed for certain services. It sets
the configuration parameter <tt>display_name</tt>. This name is available as
a column when creating new views or modifying existing ones. It is always
visible in the details view of a service. In the availability reporting there
is an option for using that name instead of the normal service description. It
does not automatically replace the normal service name in all views.

<b>Note</b>: The purpose of this rule set is to define unique names for several
well-known services. It cannot rename services in general.
