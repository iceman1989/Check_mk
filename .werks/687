Title: New summary pages with all settings of a host or service

In WATO there is now a new summary page for each host and each service. This
is called by a button <i>Parameters</i> for the host or the already existing
"triangle" icon in the services list.

In this page you can see all of the host's or service's settings that are
determined by rules (via <i>Host &amp; Service Parameters</i>).  You will only
see the current setting of each parameter and also whether it is determined
by one or more matching rules or whether it is at its default value.  A click
brings you directly to the according rule set or even rule. This all makes
it much simpler to get an overview over all <i>effective</i> settings of a
host and also gives you a fast access to each setting.
