Title: df: dynamic filesystem levels now reorder levels automatically
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1384355214
Class: feature

When defining several step for dynamic filesystem levels, e.g. one for
disk greater then 10GB, of for disks greater then 100GB and one for
filesystems greater then 0B (the rest), then you had to make sure that
the step for lagers disks would appear later. Otherwise they would be
ignored. This is now fixed and Check_MK automatically chooses the correct
step for a disk - regardless of the order.
