Title: mem.used, solaris_mem: Introduce optional averaging of used memory
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1389699478
Class: feature

You now can set an averaging time horizon in minutes. If you do that the
levels for the used memory will be applied to its average over time. That
makes the check less reactive to peaks in the memory usage.
