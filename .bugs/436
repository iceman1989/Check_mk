Title: sounds/ URL create Popup on Windows 7
Component: multisite
State: works4me

In Windows 7 when you Multisite plays a sound file (e.g.
due to a problem shown in the dashboard), a HTTP
auth window pops up. The reason seems to be that
the sounds URL is excluded from Auth via the
apache config of Multisite. IE seems to think that
it can log out.

I can not reproduce this using Windows 7 + IE9. The problem may be strongly related
to the handler for the wav files. I had quicktime installed which could not play
these files. Then I uninstalled quicktime. After that the IE used the windows media
player to play the wav files and this worked with the current apache config / code.
