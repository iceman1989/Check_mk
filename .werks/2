Title: You can now annotate events in the availability reporting

Class: feature

In the availability reporting there is now the possibility for annotating outages. In fact you
can attach an annotation to any arbitrary span of time of a host or service. For creating new
annotations you need to go to the "Timeline" view of a host or service. At each single period
there is now a new icon for creating an annotation (or changing an existing one).

Once the editor dialog is open you can decide to modify the time span, for example in order to
make the annotation cover a larger time period.

In any availability view all annotations that match the shown period of
time and selection of hosts and services are being displayed.

The annotations are saved globally and are shared amongst all users.
