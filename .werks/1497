Component: multisite

Class: feature

Passwords of local (htpasswd) users can now be enforced to be changed.
Existing user sessions will be invalidated, the user will be logged off,
needs to login again and change his password afterwards. This can be
set in the user profile.

A password policy can now be configured for globally all local users
which can enforce the users to choose passwords of a minimal length
which are using at least X character groups.
It is also possible to define a maximum age for passwords, after which
the user needs to change the password.
