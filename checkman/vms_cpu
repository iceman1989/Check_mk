description:
 Check CPU utilization (user, system, idle) and IO-Wait on an
 OpenVMS system. The number of CPUs is taken into account so that
 maximum percentage is 100% is refers to the total CPUs available.

 A level can be set only on {wait} (disk wait).

perfdata:
 Three variables: The percentage of time spent in {user}, {system} and {wait}
 (disk wait). The idle time can be computed by substracting those three values
 from 100%. The user value contains also {nice}.

inventory:
 One check per host is created for OpenVMS systems.

[parameters]
warning (int): The percentage of {wait} that triggers a warning level.
critical (int): The percentage of {wait} that triggers a critical level
 The parameters may also be set to {None}, which makes the check alwas {OK}.

[configuration]
vms_cpu_default_levels (int, int): Default levels used by inventorized
  checks. This is present to {None}, which disables the levels.
