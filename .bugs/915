Title: More comfortable handling of "Performance Counters" monitoring
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: feature

At the moment the ids of performancecounters must be scanned and configured
manually (http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_windows.html#H1:Performance%20Counters,%20monitoring%20MS%20Exchange%20%3Cb%20class=new%3E1.1.11i1%3C/b%3E)

This is not very comfortable and also no auto detection. It would be nice to have
a functionality where we can deliver a default config or one user could create
his own config like:

[winperf]
    counters = $MSExchangeTransport Queues$:msx_queues

Then, on agent startup the variable would be used to scan for the id automatically.
The localization problem has to be fixed when implementing this. Maybe there is
something like LANG=c ...?
