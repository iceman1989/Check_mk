Title: Quicksearch on Chrome: key down/up does not work
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-11-19 15:29:03
Targetversion: 1.2.0

Reason is unclear. Down should move the selection field down in order
to select a host without the mouse.

The event handling was broken for chrome. Simplified the arrow key handling now, 

Tested in FF, Chrome, IE.
