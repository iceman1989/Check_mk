Title: chrony: new check for NTP synchronization via chrony on Linux
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1408471050
Class: feature

This check does the same as the existing {ntp.time} check, but is for
cases when {chrony} is being used instead of the {ntpd}. It does not
support measuring jitter, however.
