Title: Implement locking in WATO
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-24 19:49:08
Targetversion: 1.2.0

We need to prevent multiple users using WATO at the same time
getting into conflict. This should be done in the following way:

[1] All action-URLs will do an exclusive locking including a
    waiting for the lock

[2] When activating changes we have a look into the pending
    log. When there are changes of another user then we
    print a warning and confirmation message, that foreign
    changes are going to be activated.

[3] Activating foreign changes will need a special permission.

Still people need to make sure that the use personalized logins.
