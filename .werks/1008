When using the Check_MK Micro Core as the core then the service status for Check_MK
services that ran into an overal timeout (default is 60 seconds) was UNKNOWN. This
has changed to CRIT. Furthermore this is configurable via a new <i>Timeout</i>
option in the ruleset <i>Status of the Check_MK service</i>.
