This fixes the following issue:

The check_mk application is susceptible to reflected XSS attacks. This is
mainly the result of inproper output encoding. Reflected XSS can be triggered
by sending a malicious URL to a user of the check_mk application. Once the
XSS attack is triggered, the attacker has access to the full check_mk (and
nagios) application with the access rights of the logged in victim.

The fix applies to the function:

htmllib.py: render_status_icons()
actions.py: ajax_action()
