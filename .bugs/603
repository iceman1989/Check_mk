Title: default_language not honored by login maski
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-01-25 09:58:35
Targetversion: 1.2.0

I've translated "Username" and "Password" into 'de'. Then I've
set default_language = 'de' in multisite.mk. Texts are not
translated in the Cookie based login form, even after are restart
of Apache. The I login, set my user language to 'de' and logout.
Now the login screen is in German. After a logout the login screen
is in German. Restarting Apache now switches it back to english.
