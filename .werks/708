Title: ntp.time, ntp: avoid DNS lookups in NTP queries and avoid timeouts
Level: 2
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1391698980
Class: fix

The ntpq queries in the various Unix agents now call ntpq with the option
-n. This avoids DNS lookups. Note: the ntp.peers check will then display
IP addresses instead of host names. That check will fail if you do not
have fixed IP addresses.
