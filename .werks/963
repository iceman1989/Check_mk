Title: New snapin with virtual host trees
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1399027191
Class: feature

We have added a new snapin to Multisite: <i>Virtual Host Tree</i>. This snapin allows you to
have trees of your hosts created based upon tags. In order to use this simply add the snapin
to your sidebar and go to the <i>Global Settings</i>, section <i>Status GUI (Multisite)</i>
and the new setting <i>Virtual Host Trees</i>.

You can create an arbitrary number of virtual trees. They will be globally visible for
all users. Each tree consists of a sequence of tag groups. Let's assume that you have
created a virtual tree from the three fictive tag groups <i>Location</i>, <i>Application</i>
and <i>Criticality</i>. The virtual host tree will then have tree levels. At the
top level there is the selection of the location, on the second level the application
and on the leaf-level the criticality.

A click of an arbitrary node of the tree brings you to all hosts having the selected
tags.
