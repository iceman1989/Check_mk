Title: Settings in multisite.mk without default values persist in browser cache
Component: multisite

Targetversion: 1.2.3
Class: bug

If you write an extension (like mkeventd) that wants to put a settings
into multisite.mk then it cannot put a default value into config.py (it
must not modify files of the main distribution). If it once sets a value in
multisite.mk and that is later removed (factory settings) then the positive
settings survives in the browser cache. We need to find a method how extension
modules can define or declare default values for settings in multisite.mk

Solved by implementing config-plugin hierarchy.
