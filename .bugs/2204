Title: Make PNP graphs in notifications user independent
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-11-18 10:18:50
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

When using bulk notifications to send mails to a non-contact, the graphs can not
be fetched from PNP, because there is no user context. This seems to need a patch
for PNP, because we need to provide a user name which is then checked against
livestatus for permission on the service or host.

A possible good fix could be to patch pnp that the permission check is disabled
when executed from command line.
