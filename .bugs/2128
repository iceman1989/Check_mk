Title: mk-job: Start time is only available after job finished
Component: checks

This should really be changed. The start time should be available once the job has been
started. The check needs to deal with the old job info and the start time of the just
started and currently running job while the job is running.

Has been fixed. The check does process the currently running commands start_time.
