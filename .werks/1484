Title: dell_om_sensors: Use sensor name as item
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415030487
Class: feature

The checks of the type <tt>dell_om_sensors</tt> now use the sensor
name rather then its index as the item. Also the check now allows to
set levels that are more strict than the builtin critical level.
This is done by using the same code now as in all other temperature
checks. Also the check output is compatible now.

Because of the renaming of the item a re-inventory will create
one new item for each sensor.
