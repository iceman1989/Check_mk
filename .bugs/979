Title: winperf_phydisk: better handle counter wraps
Component: checks
State: open

Class: nastiness

If you reboot a server then the diskstat.include based checks
need many cycles before the produce output again. This shows
up with the new staleness feature. 

Resolution: handle CounterWrapped exceptions and make sure, that
all counters are handled, even if one exception occurs.
