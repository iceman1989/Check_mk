Title: Oracle Sessions should be able to define limits per Database
Component: checks
State: open

Targetversion: 1.2.0
Class: feature

The oracle_sessions check has has warn/crit levels. If using WATO those can only
be specified as a "global" value because no service name can be specified.
A user tried to work around this using the inventory->ruleset shortcut but that
didn't help either.

We should change the WATO interface for the check, to make it support the 
same configuration as is available on the CLI-side of things.
