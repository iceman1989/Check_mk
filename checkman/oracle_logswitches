title: Log switch activity of ORACLE database
agents: linux, hpux, windows, solaris
catalog: app/oracle
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check monitors the number of log switches of an ORACLE
 database instance in the last 60 minutes. You can set levels
 for upper and lower bounds.

 This check needs the Check_MK {mk_oracle}-plugin installed in
 the agent. Please refer to the online documentation
 for how to install that plugin.

item:
 The SID of the database (as appearing in the process
 name of the pmon_... process).

examples:
 # Set global default values. Make it critical if there
 # is only 1 or 0 logswitches or 100 or more in the last
 # hour.
 oracle_logswitches_default_levels = (1, 3, 30 100)

perfdata:
 One value: the number of log switches in the last 60 minutes.

inventory:
 One separate check for each database found running will
 be created.

[parameters]
lo_crit(int): The check will get critical if only that many (or fewer) log switches appeared in the
 last 60 minutes. Set this to {-1} in order to disable this bound.
lo_warn(int): Lower warning level.
hi_warn(int): Make the check warn if there were at least that many log switches in the last 60 minutes.
hi_crit(int): Upper critical level.

[configuration]
oracle_logswitches_default_levels(int, int, int, int): Global default levels used for all checks which have no specific configuration. This is preset to {(-1, -1, 50, 100)}.
