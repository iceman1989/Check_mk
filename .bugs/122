Title: --snmpwalk creates OIDs without leading .

The --snmpwalk stores the OIDs without a leading dot, 
whereas the real snmpwalk outputs a dot. This leads
to slightly incompatible behaviour in some checks.
Resolution: make --snmpwalk also prepend a dot.

Note: This was detected in a case where OID_STRING
was used.

This has already been fixed some time ago.
