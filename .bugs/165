Title: Automatic detection of host tags

A quite new idea: during inventory we could allow check types
to make hints for host tags. The way we could set automatic
host tags which would be saved in var/check_mk/autotags/$HOST
(or maybe a global file for all hosts together)?

Also the SNMP scan could set an auto tag after trying if
SNMPv2c is possible. That way the manual configuration
of bulkwalk hosts would be neccessary only in a few
rare situtations.

Possible examples for autotags:

- Type of Agent (snmp, linux, windows, hpux, etc.)
- Operating System (sles10)
- Architecture (x86_64, ppc, etc.)
- Type of device (host, switch, appliance, ?)
