Title: esx_vsphere_counters_ramdisk: Sizes seem not to be consistent over all systems
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2013-12-02 09:12:56
Targetversion: 1.2.3i6
Class: cleanup

The problem: The agent can not provide the sizes of the ram disks. The check has
a mapping table with the sizes of the ram disks. The assumption was that all
ram disks have a fixed size on all systems. This seems to be wrong.
At the moment, this can be overridden via main.mk, not via WATO. Make this configurable
via WATO.
