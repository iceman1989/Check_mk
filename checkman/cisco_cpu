description:
 Check CPU utilization of the last 5 minutes in percent on Cisco devices.
 This check tests for two oids out of {cpmCPUTotalEntry}:

 {.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.5.1 = cpmCPUTotal5min}

 {.1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.8.1 = cpmCPUTotal5minRev}

 The latter is depreceated by cisco and will only be used if {cpmCPUTotal5minRev}
 is unavailable.


perfdata:
 Just one value: The CPU utilization of the last 5 minutes in percent.

inventory:
 One service per Cisco device is created.

[parameters]
warning (int): The percentage of CPU utilization that triggers a warning level.
critical (int): The percentage of CPU utilization that triggers a critical level.

[configuration]
