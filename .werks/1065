Title: heartbeat_crm / heartbeat_crm.resources: Rewrote checks / formalized parameters
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1406626271
Class: feature

Both checks heartbeat_crm and heartbeat_crm.resources nailed down the resources / DC to
the node which held the resources / DC during inventory. This was not fitting most users
requirements and has been changed. By default the node currently holding the resources / DC
does not matter anymore as long as they are held by at least one node.

If you like to change this behaviour back to the old default, you need to configure the
inventory rule <tt>Heartbeat CRM Inventory</tt> and re-run an inventory on the affected
hosts.

Already inventorized checks should continue working as they did before. The change only
affects newly inventorized services.

Two new WATO rules <tt>Heartbeat CRM general status</tt> and <tt>Heartbeat CRM resource status</tt>
have been added to make the parameters of these checks configurable.
