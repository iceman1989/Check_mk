description:
 This check measures the usage of ASM Disk Groups.  The usage
 is checked against a warning and a critical level, which
 can be specified in numerous ways.

 {Requirements:} The {mk_oracle} is needed on the monitored machines.
 See details for mk_oracle at manpage of oracle_instance.

 {Trends:} This checks supports Disk Group {trends}. This means that the
 check is able to compute the change of the used space over the time
 and can make a forecast into the future. It can estimate the time when
 the Disk Group will be full.

 In a default configuration the check will compute the trend based on the
 data of the last 24 hours using a logarithmic average that gives more recent
 data a higher weight. Also data beyond the 24 hours will to some small degree be
 reflected in the computation. The advantage of this algorithm is a more
 precise prediction and a simpler implementation, which does not need any
 access to any RRDs or similar storage.

 Please note that when a Disk Group is started to be monitored,
 the trend of the past is unknown and is assumed to be {zero}.
 It will take at least one trend range of time until the trend
 approximately reflects the reality.

item:
 The name of the disk group as delivered by the agent without the {/} at the
 end.

 See also check manpage for {df}. All configurations are usable for ORACLE ASM
 Disk Groups as well.

examples:
 # Set default levels for all filesystems (including ORACLE ASM Disk Groups)
 # to 90/95
 asm_diskgroup_default_levels = (90, 95)

 # more examples in check manpage for df

perfdata:
 see check manpage for df

inventory:
 Creates one check for every Disk Group in the agent's output.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): see check manpage for df. The following parameters
 are added for more functionality.

 {"req_mir_free"}: If this is set to {True}, the free space is checked
 against the req_mir_free instead of free_mb. This works only for
 {normal} or {high} redundancy Disk Groups. An information for this is
 added to the check output, when {req_mir_free} is {True}

[configuration]
asm_diskgroup_default_levels: see check manpage for df and comments above
filesystem_default_levels: is not valid anymore! Please use {asm_diskgroup_default_levels}
