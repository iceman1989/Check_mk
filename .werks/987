Title: New button for updating DNS cache
Level: 2
Component: wato
Version: 1.2.5i4
Date: 1401897453
Class: feature

In the host details page in WATO there is now a new button <i>Update DNS Cache</i>. If you
press this button, then all cached IP addresses of hosts on the same site as the host currently
edited are being updated.

Use this button when you have not specified an explicit address for a host and that host's
IP address has been changed in your DNS (and you are not willing to wait for the next
regular update).
