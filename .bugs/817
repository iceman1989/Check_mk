Targetversion: 1.2.3

The PING check should remain on the host when the host has the tag
"ping" assigned, event when a legacy check has been added to the host.

Resolution: Create a WATO rule for check_icmp as active check. That
way the user can do all he wants...

2013-10-21 21:00:00: changed state open -> done
Rule for check_icmp already exists.
