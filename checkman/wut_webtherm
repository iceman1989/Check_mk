description:
 This check monitors the temperature of sensors attached
 to a WuT (Wiesemann & Theis) Web-Thermograph.

item:
 The item is the number of the sensor as string - usuall {"1"}.

perfdata:
 One variable: the current temperature in degrees celsius.

inventory:
 All available temperature sensors are automatically inventorized.

examples:
 # set default levels for all webtherms
 wut_webtherm_defaultlevels = (25, 30)

 # set more rigid levels for all hosts with the tag {zuluft}
 # for the first sensor, by defining explicit checks:
 zuluft_levels = ( 19, 25 )
 checks += [
  ( [ "zuluft" ], ALL_HOSTS, "wut_webtherm", "1", zuluft_levels )
 ]

 # Set even mor specific levels for one thermometer
 checks += [
   ("webtherm3", "wut_webtherm", '1', (15, 18) ),
 ]

[parameters]
warning (int): Temperature at which a warning level is triggered
critical (int): Critical level for temperature

[configuration]
wut_webtherm_defaultlevels (int, int): Default levels for warning
 and critical. This is preset to {(30,35)}.
