Title: fc_port: Fixed invalid values of counters, fixed wrong values in graphs
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1414156402
Class: fix

Previous versions of the checks computed wrong values for all counters like
transfered bytes, errors etc. This has been fixed now.

The performance graphs, for example error counters, were using wrong datasources
which made the graphs show dramatically wrong values.
