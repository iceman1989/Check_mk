Title: Windows Agent switches disk IO label on reboot

Targetversion: 1.2.3

when a windows maschine has 2 (or maybe more) logical volumes on one physical
disk, only one „Disk IO“ is found by the inventory. When a maschine
reboots sometimes a switch occours. On our machines this switches between
Disk IO C: and Disk IO E: as they have a C: and an E: drive.

When a maschine has two logical disks each on a physical disk the behavior
is not seen.
