Title: Path in debug_log is wrong in distributed WATO setups
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-11-24 15:07:07
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

The shown path always shows the path on the centeral site. It should either
show the path to the correct site, or better, just a spacer which indicates
that the site id needs to be put into the path.

Fixed.
