Title: Allow to spread times of next check when rescheduling

Class: feature

When you do the action <i>Reschedule active checks</i> for more than one
active checks then you now can enter a number of minutes. All checks will
then be distributed evenly over that time.

This feature is interesting for checks with larger intervals. Most prominent
example is the <tt>Check_MK Inventory</tt> check, which usually is done every
2, 4 or 24 hours. By spreading the executing of these checks you avoid large
peaks in CPU load.
