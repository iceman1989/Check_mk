Title: Remove update-alternatives stuff on Debuntu packages

Currently the *.deb packages use the alternatives-mechanism in order to
select the current default version and for handling the symlink of /usr/bin/omd.
Remove this and use the same mechanism as with RPM. Our deb packages anyway 
can never adhere to the Debian package guidelines. So better make sure that
they exactly behave like on rpm based systems.
