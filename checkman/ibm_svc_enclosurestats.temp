description:
 Checks the temperature in enclosures of an IBM SVC / Storwize V3700 / V7000 device.

 The check returns {WARN} or {CRIT} if the temperature in degree celsius is higher
 then given levels and {OK} otherwise.

 Please note: You need the Special Agent agent_ibmsvc to retrieve the monitoring
 data from the device. Your monitoring user must be able to SSH to the device
 with SSH Key Authentification. Please exchange SSH key. The Special Agent itself
 can be configured by WATO.

item:
 The ID of the enclosure.

inventory:
 Creates one check per enclosure.

perfdata:
 One value: The temperature in degree celsius, together with it's levels for
 warn and crit.

examples:
 # set default levels to 30 and 45 percent:
 ibm_svc_enclosurestats_temperature_default_levels = (30, 45)

 # Check temperature of enclosure 1 on a IBM SVC called my-svc with default levels
 checks += [
   ("my-svc", "ibm_svc_enclosurestats.temp", '1', ibm_svc_enclosurestats_temperature_default_levels)
 ]

 # or use individual levels for warn and crit
 checks += [
   ("my-svc", "ibm_svc_enclosurestats.temp", '1', (40, 50))
 ]

[parameters]
parameters (int, int): temperature levels in degree celsius for {WARN} and {CRIT}

[configuration]
ibm_svc_enclosurestats_temperature_default_levels (int, int): The standard levels
    for {WARN} and {CRIT}, preset to (35, 40)
