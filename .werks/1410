Title: Output log text of scheduled downtime log entries
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6

Class: feature

Multisite now shows the text that is attached to a scheduled downtime start/stop in the
monitoring logfile when showing the history of a host or service. Alas, Nagios does not
log anything useful in those entries. The Check_MK Micro Core logs the downtime comment,
which is by that way now visible in the historic views of Multisite.
