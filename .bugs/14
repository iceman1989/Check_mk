Currently Livestatus correctly handles 2-Byte UTF-8
sequences, assumes all other non-Ascii Characters to
be Latin-1 encoded. While this works well for Western
languages, other non-Latin1 languages not not supported.

We can do it the following way: We introduce a module
option "data_encoding", which is either "mixed", "latin1" or "utf-8".
The default is "utf-8".

the "mixed" mode is the current implementation. The "utf-8"
mode assumes all Nagios-strings to be UTF-8 encoded and 
outputs the according escape sequences for JSON/Python.

In mode "latin1" all characters are interpreted as one-byte
Latin-1 encoded characters and the according escape
codes for UTF-8 are produced.

The programmer has to make sure, that this encoding matches
the encoding used in COMMAND queries. Strings in that 
query are never transcoded but put 1:1 into Nagios.
