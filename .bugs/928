Querying large timeframes within the statehist table can eat up
lots of time. This is because for every host/service an object is
generated which stores the data.
On global changes (timeperiod change) each of these objects need to be updated

Sometimes the query just want to get info about a single host - using Filters
statehist disregards this wish when collecting data, thus resulting in the slow performance

Possible solution:
Take the queries filter into account when creating the objects for the host/services
