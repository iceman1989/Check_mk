Title: csv_export: now able to handle umlauts in download filenames
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i1

Class: fix

The csv export function raised an exception when the
type of the filename was set to unicode. This happened when
the filename text contained umlauts.
Filenames are now converted to utf-8 in this case.
