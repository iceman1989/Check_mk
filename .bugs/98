Title: Restart of Nagios makes Multisite murk
Component: multisite
State: done

When Nagios is restarted (e.g. via WATO), then for a short time the
Livestatus socket is gone. This leads to error messages in various
places - e.g. snapins and also AJAX functions which produce jQuery
errors.

We need to find a solution for a cleaner handling of this. Couldn't
be a site in the state "restarting". If yes - how can we detect such
a state. The livestatus socket is missing in such a case.

jQuery was removed - the window is gone.

2011-05-24 11:08:02: changed state done -> done
All Ajax-Requests now get a clean error code 500 and handle this
in case of Livestatus errors.
