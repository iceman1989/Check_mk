Title: Impossible to change availability time range when too long to process the page
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.3i6

It is impossible to fix time ranges set by the user in the GUI, when the currently choosen
range results in a never loading availability page, since the settings can only be changed 
that page that never loads.

By imposing a time limit on the query.
