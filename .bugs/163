Title: backgrounds in downtime view not shown for host downtimes
Component: multisite
State: done
Class: nastiness
Date: 2011-03-01 14:42:34
Fun: 0

The problem is that the host_state is not fetched via livestatus. These code parts were written by sir hack-a-lot ;-).
This would workaround the problem and bring the color to the host columns . And the host_state and host_has_been_checked columns are fetched from much more views (maybe useless in most cases).

Patch:

Background color is correctly shown for host rows e.g. in "Comments" view
for example when a host is DOWN the row has lightred background
