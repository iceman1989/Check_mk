 If at least one disk is found, exactly one check will be created for
 the host.

 # Expect 5 available(=online) and one spare disk
 checks += [
   ( 'arc', 'fjdarye60_disks.summary', None, { "available": 5, "spare": 1 } )

 {"available"}, {"broken"}, {"notavailable"}, {"notsupported"},{"present"},
 {"readying"}, {"recovering"}, {"partbroken"}, {"spare"}, {"formating"},
