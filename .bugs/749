Title: Multisite setup with cookie based login garbles PNP webservice
Component: multisite
Class: bug

Targetversion: 1.2.0

If you use cookie based authentication and a multisite setup and if the
auth.secret is not replicated - so that your login does not automatically
work for the remote site, then two nasty things happen:

1. If you hover over the PNP icon will show the login screen in place where
the PNP hover graphs should appear - and also garble styles.

2. If you click on the details of a remote service (i.e. a view with a
remote PNP graph embedded), then Chrome will go into an endless loop
again and again loading the page. This must have to do something with
the PNP webservice returning HTML code that will somehow redirect to
the login page.

Sent patch to be integrated into pnp to fix the problem. PNP module won't
send any Location-Redirects when calling graph/json/popup controllers.
