title: Usage of physical and virtual RAM
agents: aix
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the current usage of physical RAM and
 virtual memory used by processes on AIX. You can define a warning
 and critical level for the usage of virtual memory,
 {not} for the usage of RAM.

 This check uses the same logic as {mem.used} - the memory check
 for Linux. Please see details there.

inventory:
  One check is created if a non-empty {<<<aix_memory>>>} section is
  present in the agent output.

perfdata:
 Three variables are stored: the physical RAM,
 the used swap space and the sum of both. Maximum
 values for both variables are also transmitted, so that
 they can be visualized. All values are in Megabytes (1024 * 1024 bytes).

 The template for PNP4Nagios that is shipped with Check_MK
 stacks swap usage on top of RAM usage und thus shows
 the amount of virtual RAM that is used by processes.

[parameters]
parameters (dict):
  {"levels"}: A pair of two int or float values: if these are
  float it means the the percentage of virtual memory used
  by processes at which WARNING/CRIT state is triggered. If the
  two numbers are defined as an integer value then they are interpreted
  as an absolute value in megabytes.

  {"average"}: This key is optional. If set (integer), it means
  a number of minutes. The levels are then applied to the
  averaged value over that time horizon.
