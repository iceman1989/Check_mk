The view and edit permissions of specific NagVis maps of the local
NagVis installation can now be managed using multisite contactgroups and roles.

Each contactgroup can have several NagVis maps assigned which permitts
all users which are members of the groups to the assigned maps.

Using the roles you can configure whether or not users are only allowed to view,
edit and/or delete their permitted maps.

This feature is only available in OMD environments.
