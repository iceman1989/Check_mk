Title: ups_test: Fix computation of time since last self test
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Instead of the time since the last self test of the battery, the check used
the time the last test has <i>lasted</i>. So this check did not trigger
an alarm every - just for the summary state of the last test.

Thanks for the bug report to Cyril Pawelko!
