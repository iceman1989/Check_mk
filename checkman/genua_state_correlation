description:
 This check monitors if the two or more carp interfaces found on genuscreen
 devices have the same carp state. If not, the check is critical.

 The check is known to run with genuscreen version 3.0 and 4.1, supports
 genuas regular enterprise id 3717 as well as the id 3137 which was
 introduced in a bug in some versions of genuscreen.

perfdata:
 None

inventory:
 The inventory process checks if the device has a system description OID
 of .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 and if the name of this OID contains "genuscreen"
 (case insensitive).
 If this is true and at least two carp interfaces are found, then the system
 is inventorized.
