Title: DRBD check should allow configurable alert level for flipped roles

Class: feature

The check for DRBD status also keeps an eye on the roles of the DR:BD nodes. If
the primary and secondary roles switch on both nodes, the check will go to
critical for historical reasons.  For many people it would only be considered
a WARNING or even OK assuming that the primary is working and serving requests.
