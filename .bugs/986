Title: Delay sidebar reload after changes to site config
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2013-10-15 01:37:53
Targetversion: 1.4.0
Class: nastiness

If you change the site configuration via WATO then the
sidear is reloaded. But: at exactly the same time the
liveproxyd is being restarted and all sites are down
for 1-2 seconds. The sidebar is reloaded in exactly that
point of time. Consequnce:

- Tactical overview does not show remote hosts
- Site status is [dead] for all remote sites.

Can't we delay the reload for a small time?
