Title: Configuring timeperiod exceptions is buggy
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-04-25 12:34:06
Targetversion: 1.2.0

- When creating one timeperiod exception it is ok. When changing the definition in the first field
  WATO creates a second exception entry from it but leaves the old.

- Deleting an exception is not possible. It remains when clearing the fields.

- On user errors the form focuses the alias field all the time.

Possible fix: Migrate to valuespecs.
