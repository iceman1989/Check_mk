Title: Quicksearch: multiple hostname matches now lead to the searchhost view instead of the hosts view
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Version: 1.2.5i5
Date: 1405937822
Class: feature

When a Quicksearch pattern matched multiple hosts the view <i>All hosts</i> was shown.
This view displayed all services for these hosts, which could lead to plenty of (unwanted) output in the view.
The quicksearch feature has been changed in the following way:

<ul>
<li>If there are multiple host matches the <i>Search Host</i> view is displayed</li>
<li>If there is a single match the <i>Host</i> view is displayed (this view also contains the services)</li>
</ul>

Note: This also applies to special search patterns like <tt>h:localhost h:otherhost</tt>
