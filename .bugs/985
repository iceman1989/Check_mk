Title: Reloading sidebar after config change erases Quicksearch
Component: multisite
State: open

Class: nastiness

If you active changes via WATO then the sidebar reloads.
That way Quicksearch is emptied. This is nasty.

1. You add a new host to the monitoring
2. You activate the changes
3. You type in the new hostname in Quicksearch
4. The host name is erased right now because of the reload

Does the Quicksearch need to be reloaded at the first place?
It's now AJAX-enabled, isn't it?
