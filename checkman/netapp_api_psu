description:
 The check monitors the state of the shelfes power supplies for a NetApp filer.
 Since a filer may run in a clustered mode there was a requirement to determine
 which power supplies are managed by that filer. The following approach is used:
 If a filer possess most of the disks in a shelf, the shelf is considered as owned
 and the power supplies also belong to the filer.

 Whenever a power supply fails the check reports {CRIT} and outputs the shelf unique
 id together with the power supply number.

inventory:
 On check is created for the entire filer.
