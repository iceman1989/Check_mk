Targetversion: 1.2.0

When multiple users make modifications then it's a problem
if one users activates the changes while modifications of
other users are not yet finished. We could solve this the
following way:

* When activating changes we check in the audit log of
the pending changes of changes from another user are
pending.

* If that is the case, we display a special warning.

* We craete a permissions that is needed in order
to activate Changes when one whould activate 
changes of another user.

* We modify the icon in the activate Changes button
so that the user can see that foreign changes
are pending.
