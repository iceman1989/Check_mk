When using the Check_MK Micro Core and at the same time check plugins output
debug information to stdout, the communication with the core was garbled
up and the check helper died with an exception. This fix eliminates any
unauthorized output to stdout be removing the filedescriptor to a save place
and replacing stdout with <tt>/dev/null</tt>.
