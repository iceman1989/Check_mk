If you press the reschedule button on the Check_MK service then it
sometimes misses the update of the passive services of Check_MK.
It might be sufficient to add a short delay of 0.5 sec in order to
make sure they are always updated.

Delay of 0.7 sec is introduced for Check_MK. Seems to be enough.
