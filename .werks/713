Title: New bulk notifications

Class: feature

The new rule based notifications now also support a new feature called <i>Bulk Notifications</i>. The
idea is to send multiple notifications, that are created within a short time frame, within one email and
not as separate emails. This can help in situations where due to some general problem dozends of
notifications would happen in a sort time. Also it can be used in order to create something similar
to mailing list digests: you can get informed about all problems once a day. Please refer to the
<a href="http://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_rbn.html">online documentation</a> for details.
