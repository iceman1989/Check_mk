Title: View checkboxes: Request-URI Too Large
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2012-05-28 16:16:51
Targetversion: 1.4.0

If you select too many checkboxes in a Multisite view
and execute a command, then you will get a
"Request-URI Too Large".

We need to convert the complete checkbox logic including
the page refresh to POST. This will then also fix bug
#759. Postponed until after 1.2.0.

Resolution: persist the current check state via AJAX
on a file on the server and do not try to transport
that information via GET/POST. Also consolidate Checkboxes
with WATO. WATO might need persistent checkboxes anyway.

I decided to fix this before 1.4.0 (because we had several problems
with the confirm page which was making POST requests, leading the user
in several undefined situations).

The selected rows are saved as user file named "rowselection
.mk". The selected rows in the views are reset when opening the fresh
view. The WATO selections are persisted and loaded in all situations.
