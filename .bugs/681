Targetversion: 1.2.0

When loading plugins (e.g. WATO rule_specs), and there is a syntax
or other error in the plugin, an Exception should be raised. 
Currently the plugin is silently ignored.

Simply setting loaded_with_language AFTER plugin loading. Broken
plugins will raise before reaching this code.
