Title: Windows fileinfo gets invetorized without escaping backslashes
Component: checks
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2012-11-20 15:16:48
Targetversion: 1.4.0

The fileinfo check does not escape backslashes upon inventory.  resulting items
would be i.e. c:\windows\test.ini WATO on the other hand does escape them,
and in the end the WATO rules do not match & apply to the service as intended

MK: I'm not sure if this really is a bug or just the problem, that WATO
interprets texts as regular expressions (which again interprets backslashes!)

Resolution: We put a nice icon into each text input that is being interpreted
as regex. When you hover over the icon (or click on it?) you get a help
page about regular expressions with nice examples etc.

When creating rules WATO now escapes regex-chars, so this should e
no problem.
