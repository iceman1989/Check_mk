Title: Fixed incorrect formatting of checks with long output
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1390322620

Long output in check_mk checks was not formatted accordingly.
Newlines within a checks output are now escaped correctly: \n -> \\n

The incorrect formatting in previous versions could lead to missing long output texts in the monitoring core.
