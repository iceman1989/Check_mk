Title: OMD user cannot do --scan-parents

As an OMD user you cannot always do a parent scan since
traceroute might miss the SUID bit. We could make the
command configurable in main.mk and maybe prepare OMD
such that it always works correctly...

I've checked this out on Ubuntu. Everything is working fine here,
without SETUID bit.
