Title: cmc problem with parents
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-08-30 12:37:32
Targetversion: 1.2.3

when running site with cmc, parents of a host are not shown in multisite gui in host status page
even if there are configured some
maybe parent hosts are ignored completely??

if running the same site with nagios core, the parents are displayed on host status page

2013-10-03 12:33:07: changed state open -> done
War wohl das Cache-Program von NagVis mit program_start, das
inzwischen behoben ist.
