Title: Simulation mode overrides usewalk_hosts

If you have some hosts defined as usewalk hosts so that they'll check based on their already
recorded snmpwalks and then enable simulation_mode, it breaks usewalk for some reason.
The result is that the snmp devices are checked against 127.0.0.1.

This is a big problem if you simulate a customer site.

Thats the way we want it to be.
