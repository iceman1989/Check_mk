Title: Command form off at empty table, but that might change
Component: multisite
Class: nastiness
State: done
Date: 2012-06-03 20:35:28
Targetversion: future

If a view has no rows then the command form is deactivated.
But as time goes by the view might have entries. The command
form is not being activated automtically - nevertheless. Better
solution: Always have it active. When it comes to executing
give then a warning if not items for the commands are available.

The command form and checkboxes get now activated / deactivated when there are either
rows to perform actions on or not.
