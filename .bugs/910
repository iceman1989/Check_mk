Title: Distributed WATO - activate changes bad dialog handling
Component: wato
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2013-02-04 10:03:33
Targetversion: 1.2.2

When having a change pending, clicking "sync & restart", the sync is done, but no
restart is triggered. The restart has to be done again by clicking "restart".

Just fixed this.
