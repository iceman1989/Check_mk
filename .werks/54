Title: New labelling options for availability table
Level: 2
Component: reporting
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1383668860
Class: feature

In the availability reporting options there is now a new box called
<i>Labelling Options</i> with three new check boxes:

<ul>
<li><i>Do not display the host name</i>: This simply removes the column with the host name.
This is useful when you know that your report is about services of a single host anyway.</li>
<li><i>Use alternative display name for services</i>: When you have configured alternative
display names for (some of) your services then you can have this names being used instead
of the normal ones.</li>
<li><i>Do not display icons for history and timeline</i>: this simply removes the left-most
column with the icons. This is useful when you want to export the resulting table into
some report (by simply copying or screenshoting the HTML output).</li>
</ul>
