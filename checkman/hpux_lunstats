description:

 This check measures the throughput LUNs on HP-UX. This check
 is fully compatible with {diskstat} and uses the same
 parameters and configuration variables.

item:
 Either {"SUMMARY"} for a summarized check of alls LUNs or the
 name of the disk device, e.g. {"sda"}. In order to support configurations
 up to version 1.1.10 also the items {"read"} and {"write"} are supported.

examples:
 # switch inventory behaviour to 1.1.10 mode
 diskstat_inventory_mode = "legacy"

 # alternative: create one check for all disks
 diskstat_inventory_mode = "summary"

 # Set default levels for diskstat
 diskstat_default_levels = {
   "read" :    (10, 20),   # level for read MB/sec
   "write" :   (20, 40),   # level for write MB/sec
   "average" : 15,         # averaging in minutes
 }

 # Alternative: just enable averaging over 10 minutes,
 # do not apply levels:
 diskstat_default_levels = {
     "average" : 15
 }

 # Settings for certain hosts:
 check_parameters += [
   ( {"write" : (20, 50), "average" : 10 }, [ "oracle" ], ALL_HOSTS, [ "Disk IO" ])
 ]

perfdata:
  The disk throughput for read and write in bytes per second. If averaging
  is turned on, then two additional values are sent: the averaged read and
  write throughput.

  In the legacy mode only one variable: the throughput since the last check
  in in bytes(!) per second, either for read or for write.

inventory:
  The inventory is configured via {diskstat_inventory_mode}. If this is set
  to {"single"} (the default), then one check will be created for each
  disk. If it is set to {"summary"} then only one service per host will be
  created that has at least one hard disk. If set to {"legacy"} then a
  separate check for read and write will be created (deprecated).

[parameters]
"read": The levels to be applied to the read throughput. It this entry is
 {None} or missing in the dictionary, then no levels are applied. This is
 the defaut. The values are in MB per second. Setting {"read"} to {(20, 40)}
 will warn if 20 MB/s is exceeded and make the check critical at 40 MB/s.
 If averaging is turned on, then the levels are applied to the averaged
 values!

"write": The levels for the write throughput.

"average": If this is not {None}, it will be interpreted as a time range
 in minutes to do averaging over. Set this to {15} in order to have
 the levels applied to a 15-minute average instead of the current
 values (approx.). Turning the average on will also create two additional
 performance values. Make sure that your graphing tool is setup to
 a changing number of variables.

[configuration]
diskstat_defaul_levels(dict): The default parameter used for inventorized
                             checks. This is preset to the empty dictionary.
                              That means that no averaging is done and no
                              levels are applied.

diskstat_inventory_mode(string): Either {"single"} for one service per disk
 or {"summary"} for the throughput of all disks summed up in one service.
 Also possible is {"legacy"} for the old style mode (see above). Default
 is {"single"}.
