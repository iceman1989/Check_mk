Title: New optional parse_function for check API
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

When developing your own checks you sometimes need to deal
with more complex agent output that needs first to be parsed
before that actual inventory or check logic can begin to do
its works. Many checks therefore have something like a parse
function. Now you can define a <tt>"parse_function"</tt> in
the <tt>check_info</tt>. If you do that, then all agent
output (the parameter <tt>info</tt>) will always be processed
by that function before it is passed to the inventory or
check function.

Note: this is also a performance benefit since the parsing
needs now only be done once and not again for each single
check item.

Please refer to the developer documentation for more
details.
