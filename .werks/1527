Title: Fixed views missing values of some filters (serviceregex, hostgroup filters, ...)
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

With the rewrite of the views/dashboards/visuals we introduced a mechanism of transforming
views of the old format to the new format. This transform mechanism missed to transform
hard coded values of some filters where the variable names had been renamed. 

The affected filters are:

'serviceregex'
'hostregex'
'hostgroupnameregex'
'servicegroupnameregex'
'opthostgroup'
'optservicegroup'
'hostgroup'
'servicegroup'
'host_contactgroup'
'service_contactgroup'

If you already have migrated to a previous release, which transformed your views and made
you miss these filters or hard coded values, you can install a version containing this
fix, remove the file <tt>var/check_mk/web/USER/user_views.mk</tt> from your site and then
access the Web-GUI again. This should fix the problem. Be aware: By removing the user_views.mk
all your changes to your views you made since the initial creation of the user_views.mk 
will be reverted.
