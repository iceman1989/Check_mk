Title: Renamed service descriptions of filesystem, process and logwatch checks
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417688186
Class: feature

The service descriptions of several check types have been renamed in order to
be more consistent the the rest of the services. For example <tt>fs_</tt> has
been renamed into <tt>Filesystem</tt>.

In order not to run in problems this renaming is just enabled for <i>new
sites</i> per default. You can switch existing sites to the new naming
scheme with a new global WATO option <i>Use new service descriptions</i>
in the section <i>Operation mode of Check_MK</i>. Please be aware that
renaming services in operative systems have many implications, such as:

<ul>
<li>Notifications being sent about non-OK new services</li>
<li>Performance data will start new and not continue the old one</li>
<li>History and availability will break</li>
</ul>
