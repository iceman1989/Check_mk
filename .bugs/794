Title: Temporarily deactivate active checks in WATO
Component: wato
State: open
Date: 2012-10-12 16:13:51
Targetversion: future
Class: feature

WATO could offer the possibility for active checks (legacy checks, custom checks) to
be currently deactivated. Such checks would then completely vanish from Nagios
and the status GUI but would remain in the configuration so they could easily
be activated again later. This is not the same as deactivating active checks
in Nagios.
