description:
 Checks the Fibre Channel Ports in QLogic SANbox Fibre Channel Switches.

 AdminStatus online is evaluated to be {OK}, offline is evaluated to be {CRIT}
 and testing to be {WARN}.

 Operational Status online is evaluated to be {OK}, offline or linkFaillure
 are evaluated to be {CRIT} and testing to be {WARN}.

 The worst of the both states is returned by the check.

 Bytes per second, Frames per second and the error rates are just graphed.
 At the moment they do not trigger any status change.

 If OperMode can be detected, it is also displayed.

item:
 The Port ID taken from SNMP. It contains 2 numbers separated by a dot,
 e. g. 1.1

perfdata:
 Values for in and out in Bytes per second. rxframes (in) and txframes (out)
 in frames per second and the following error counters (errors per second):
 link_failures, sync_losses, prim_seq_proto_errors, invalid_tx_words,
 invalid_crcs, address_id_errors, link_reset_ins, link_reset_outs, ols_ins,
 ols_outs, discards, c2_fbsy_frames, c2_frjt_frames

inventory:
 Creates one check for every FC Port found by SNMP in AdminStatus "online" or
 "testing" and Operational Status "online" or "testing".

 To change this behavior, please edit the configuration variables, see section
 "configuration".
