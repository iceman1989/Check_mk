Title: Added option to make HTML escape in plugin outputs configurable

It is now possible to disable the HTML escaping in plugin outputs and
log messages. This is useful if one really wants to use HTML codes
provided by check plugins or log messages. Disabling the escaping
makes it possible to inject HTML / script code into multisite, so
be careful.
