Title: Fix computation of hour-of-the-day and day-of-month prediction
Level: 1
Component: core
Version: 1.2.3i7
Date: 1385736766
Class: fix

This fix addresses two problems in the implementation of the predictive levels:

<ul>
<li>When you selected a prediction for <i>Hour of the day</i> you would get 24
single predictions and 24 separated graphs. This has been replaced by one single
predection for the whole day, which is much more conveniant.</li>
<li>The implementation of the <i>Day of the month</i> was broken. It would create
a prediction of just one day instead. This is fixed now.</li>
</ul>
