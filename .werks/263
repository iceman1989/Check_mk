Title: livestatus log table: fixed missing logentries of archived logfiles
Level: 1
Component: liveproxy
Class: fix
State: unknown

In archived logfiles the line numbering of the logfile entries was incorrect.
The incorrect number could collide with the configuration option max_lines_per_logfile,
thus leading to an error where archive logfiles where not read completely.<br>
For example:<br>
More than 1000000 lines in â€¦.. /live/var/archives/nagios-01-20-2014-00.log. Ignoring the rest!
