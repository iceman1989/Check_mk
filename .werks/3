Title: ps: Remove exceeding [ and ] in service description when using process inventory
Level: 1
Component: checks
Version: 1.2.3i7

Class: fix

When using the process inventory with regular expressions that contain
groups, like <tt>"/sbin/getty .* (tty.)"</tt>, the matched group is inserted as
a replacement for <tt>%s</tt> in the service description. The bug resulted
in additional brackets. It was <tt>"[tty2]"</tt> instead of just <tt>"tty2"</tt>.
This has been fixed.
