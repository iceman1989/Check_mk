In Wato there is no option like PHYSICAL_HOSTS or CLUSTER_HOSTS so there should be a easy way to deactivate the HW/SW Inventory check using Wato for clusters.
If you have a big enviroment it is not fine solution to click through a couple of folders to find all clusters an add a Cluster Tag. 
Same Problem with special agents like VMware ESX.
