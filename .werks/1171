Title: Added new check for monitoring mail delivery (SMTP -> IMAP/POP3 mailbox)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415114521
Class: feature

A new check has been added which can be used to monitor your whole email
delivery process. This check sends mails out to a SMTP server of your
choice and tries to receive these sent mails by querying a POP3 or IMAP
mailbox of your choice.

You can either send the mail directly to this mailbox or use some echo
services available on the internet, like for example echo@tu-berlin.de.
Just set this as destination mail address and they will send you a response
to your SMTP mail shortly.
