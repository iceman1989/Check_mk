Title: Skip windows dhcp check if not on a server
Component: checks
Class: cleanup
State: wontfix

Targetversion: 1.2.0

If would be nice if the windows agent plugin for dhcp pools checked if its
run on an active dhcp server.  then it would be unix-like so that the plugins
autodetects applicable checks.

The official style is: don't run plugins on Windows that are
not needed on a host. In general.
