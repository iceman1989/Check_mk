Title: kernel.util: allow levels for the total CPU utilization
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1411043758
Class: feature

The CPU utilization check for Linux only allowed to set levels for the disk
wait percentage. The parameters have been converted to a dictionary and
now allow to set levels on the total CPU utilization as well.

Please note: if you have defined the variable {kernel_util_default_levels} in
your {main.mk}, then you need to convert this to a dictionary - otherwise it
will be ignored. Instead of

F+:main.mk
kernel_util_default_levels = (10, 20)
F-:

... please now write...:
F+:main.mk
kernel_util_default_levels = { "iowait" : (10, 20) }
F-:

Users of WATO are not affected by this and do not need to change anything.
