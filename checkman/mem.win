title: Usage of main memory and page file
agents: windows
catalog: os/kernel
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
 This check measures the current usage of physical RAM and
 of the Windows page file.

item:
 {None}

inventory:
 {mem.win} creates one check for each host that provides
 data about the page file. If that information is missing,
 a Unix-like system is assumed and the check {mem.used} is
 being used instead.

examples:
 # Set the default levels
 memory_win_default_levels = {
    "memory"   : (80.0, 90.0), # alert at 80%/90% usage
    "pagefile" : (2048, 1024), # alert, if less then 2/1 GB free
    "average"  : 60,           # apply levels on 60-min average
 }

 # Disable memory levels for all hosts with the tag "test"
 check_parameters += [
    ( { "memory" : (101.0, 101.0) },
      [ "test" ], ALL_HOSTS, [ "Memory and pagefile" ] ),
 ]

perfdata:
 Two variables: {memory}: the current memory usage in MB, {pagefile}: the
 current page file usage in MB.

[parameters]
parameters (dict): This check uses a dictionary as parameter. The following
 keys are defined:

 {"memory"}: Warning and critical levels of memory usage. Floating point values
 (e.g. {80.0}) are interpreted as percentages of {used} space. Integer values
 (e.g. {2048}) are interpreted as MB of {free} space.

 {"pagefile"} Warning and critical levels for page file usage. The same
 rules apply as for {memory}.

 {"average"} This optional parameters sets a value in minutes for averaging.
 In that case all warn/crit levels are applied to the averaged values.


[configuration]
memory_win_default_levels (dict): Levels used by
 all checks that are created by inventory.
