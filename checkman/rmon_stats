description:
 This check extracts data from the RMON statistics group of RMON enabled network
 interfaces. The data are described in the Remote MONitoring MIB. Several devices
 of various vendors are capable of supplying RMON data via SNMP, among them
 are some CISCO devices. It may be necessary to enable RMON for every single network
 interface you want to gather information for.

 The check always returns the state {OK}. The main purpose of the check is to gather
 network traffic statistics as performance data.

item:
 The ID of the network interface within RMON (etherStatsIndex)

inventory:
 The inventory creates one service for each network port for which RMON is activated.

perfdata:
 {bcast}: The number of broadcast packets received per second.
 {mcast}: The number of multicast packets received per second.
 {0-63b}: The number of octects of size 0-63 bytes
 {64-127b}: The number of octects pre second of size 64-127 bytes
 {128-255b}: The number of octects pre second of size 128-255 bytes
 {256-511b}: The number of octects pre second of size 256-511 bytes
 {512-1023b}: The number of octects pre second of size 512-1023 bytes
 {1024-1518b}: The number of octects pre second of size 1024-1518 bytes
