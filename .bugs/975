Title: checkmk.js - Bug with IE
Component: multisite
Class: bug
State: works4me
Date: 2013-08-26 10:21:49
Targetversion: 1.2.3i2

Since upgrade to 1.2.2p1 the Check_MK web page produces an error warning on
IE8 and IE9 browsers. I have a clean install of OMD release and the behaviour
is the same on that. The same page on Firefox browser loads OK.

To be more specific, the page loads initially OK but very soon after the error
flag is generated in IE status bar. My suspicion is that it is related to
page refresh with the dynamic ID (used I assume to avoid refresh from cache).

The error detail says

This seems to cause an error in the sidebar tools. On IE8/9 clients the
Server Time snapin and the Tactical Overview snapin are not updated. On
Firefox these do behave as expected.

I have a workaround to check for missing/undefined URL as a 1st test
in the get_url function in checkmk.js. But I can’t figure out which
routine is calling get_url with a missing parameter. (found this by adding
“alert(url);” in the function. I will try to run it again in firefox
and IE side by side to see if any further hints.)

[root@OMDTest js]# diff checkmk.js checkmk.js.original

<     if (url == undefined) {

<        return false;

<     }

[root@OMDTest js]#

 

Is this a known error? Is there any official fix/solution available?

 

 

With best regards

Seems as it has already been solved.
