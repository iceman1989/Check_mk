Class: fix

When having interfaces with nearly equal names, where the only difference is that
one has an index number as extension and the other has none, the check could not
get the correct information during checking. Example:

Intel[R] 82576 Gigabit Dual Port Network Connection 2
Intel[R] 82576 Gigabit Dual Port Network Connection
