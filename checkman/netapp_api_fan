description:
 The check monitors the state of the shelfes FAN sensors for a NetApp filer.
 Since a filer may run in a clustered mode there was a requirement to determine
 which fans are 'owned' by that filer. The following approach is used:
 If a filer possess most of the disks in a shelf, the shelf is considered as owned
 and the fans also belong to the filer.

 Whenever a fan fails the check reports {CRIT} and outputs the shelf unique id together
 with the fan element number.

inventory:
 On check is created for the entire filer.
