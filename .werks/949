Date: 1404308868
Class: feature

In the quicksearch snapin you can now enter the following syntax
C+:
h:firsthost h:otherhost h:testhost
C-:

The quicksearch dropdown will show the matches for the given names (case insensitive, no exact match).
If you want an exact hostname match you need to finish the name with $.<br>

When you press enter a host search formular will show up with the hosts given in the quicksearch field.<br>
The feature also works with host ip addresses<br>

In the quicksearch dropdown you can mix hostnames and ipaddresses - they will both show up in the dropdown.
However, the search formular is only able to display either one or the other.
