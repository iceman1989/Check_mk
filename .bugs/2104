Title: creating core config: check if used timeperiod actually exists
Component: core
Class: bug
State: done
Date: 2014-03-10 13:03:53
Targetversion: 1.2.5i1

On creating the configuration for the core, there is now validation if
a timeperiod used in any rules is actually defined. This causes a crash
in the cmc and a config validation error for the nagios core.

Example:
1) Create timeperiod named officehours

2) Manually add this (incorrect) timeperiod in main.mk
# Note: office-hours vs. officehours

extra_service_conf['notification_period'] = [
  ( 'office-hours', [], ALL_HOSTS, ALL_SERVICES ),
] + extra_service_conf['notification_period']

Has been fixed. Added validation to cmc config generator. Nagios does validation on its own
