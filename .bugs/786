If you have a cluster without any services, then Check_MK will
create a PING services. This will be UNKNOWN. Couldn't we doe
it like the host check, rather? That we call check_icmp with
the both node IP addresses?

Resolution: The PING that is created on PING-Only Clusters
should behave just like the host check:

* Use the IP Adress of the cluster if available
* PING all nodes with check_icmp otherwise

Using existing check-mk-ping-cluster command now for PING services on clusters.
