Title: Allow to allow both host name and IP address when checking for events in Event Console

The check <i>Check for events in Event Console</i> used to allow either a
match for the host name or the IP address when trying to find events that
belong to a monitored host. Now there is a new third option <i>Try both
host name and IP address</i> that will try to match the host name and the
IP address at the same time and will match the event if one of both matches
succeeds. This helps in situations where the Event Console sometimes just
gets the IP address of the remote host correctly, but has no host name.
