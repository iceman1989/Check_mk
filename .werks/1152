Title: mk-job: The check now captures currently running jobs and their start time
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6

Class: fix

Previously the check did only get data of jobs which already had finished. This
was a bit weird, because the start time and duration of the jobs could be configured
to be monitored and checked, but was not applied during runtime.

You need to update the agent plugin mk-job to make this work correctly.
