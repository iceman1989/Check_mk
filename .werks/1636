Title: Crash checks now have an icon for viewing and sending a crash dump
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: feature

If a check crashed because invalid output from agent, invalid check
parameters or a bug in the implementation of the check, then Check_MK
now creates a crash report for the according service in the directory
<tt>var/check_mk/crashed_checks/</tt>HOST<tt>/</tt>SERVICE.  In this directory
there is one informational file and the output from the agent (Check_MK agent
or SNMP). This data is then packed into a tarball, base64 encoded and added
as a long plugin output to the check.

Multisite has a new icon for displaying that data and for submitting
a bug report via email.
