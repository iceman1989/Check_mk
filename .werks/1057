Title: WATO folder permissions are only exported to NagVis when configured
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: feature

WATO exports the configured users, roles and permissions to NagVis to make
it possible to restrict access by using the permissions configured within
Multisite. In most cases the folder related permissions are not needed and
might take a lot of time to compute / process. So disabled the export
of the folder related permissions by default and made configurable using
the option {export_folder_permissions}.
