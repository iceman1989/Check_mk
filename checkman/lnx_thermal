title: Thermal sensors supported by Linux kernel
agents: linux
catalog: os/hardware
license: GPL
distribution: check_mk
description:
  This check uses the temperature information provided by the kernel in
  /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone* and reports values in °C

  The measured value is matched against levels delivered by the kernel.
  Returns {CRIT} if the kernel reports {hot} or {critical} state,
  {WARN} on any other non ok state and {OK} if the temperature is
  considered to be within normal operation temperature levels.

item:
  The ID of the thermal zone

examples:
  # adding a check for /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0
  checks += [
    ( "localhost", "lnx_thermal", "0", None )
  ]

perfdata:
  One value: The current temperature in °C

inventory:
  Creates one check for earch thermal zone.
