Title: New notification plugin for ASCII emails
Level: 2
Component: notifications

Class: feature

There is now a new notification script for ASCII emails. Just like the
HTML email template it is configurable with WATO via host rules and
notification rules. You can configure several header fields as well
as the exact body content. It also supports bulk notifications.

This new script obsoletes the plain builtin ASCII emails that are
now called <i>ASCII email (legacy)</i>.
