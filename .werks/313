The Check_MK Micro Core calls Check_MK with <tt>cmk --create-rrd --keepalive</tt>.
That read in the configuration files (<tt>main.mk</tt> etc.) twice. This could have
lead to various anomalities such as duplicate hosts when you have removed the
default <tt>all_hosts = </tt> from your <tt>main.mk</tt>. This has been fixed now.
