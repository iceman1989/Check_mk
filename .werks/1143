Title: dell_powerconnect_temp: fix configuration via WATO
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1408548253
Class: fix

When configuring levels via the rule <i>Hardware temperature</i> the levels would not
work for this check type. The reason is that - unless most of the other check plugins
for hardware temperature - this check only supports a single sensor. Therefor a new
ruleset has been created named <i>Hardware temperature, single sensor</i>. Please use
that for configuration.
