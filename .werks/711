Title: New rule based notifications
Level: 3
Component: notifications
Version: 1.2.5i1

Class: feature

Check_MK comes now with a completely new notification system called <i>Rule Based
Notifications</i>. While keeping the flexibility of the <i>Flexible Notifications</i>
it is easier to configure and at the same time even more flexible. Please
refer to <a href="http://mathias-kettner.com/checkmk_rbn.html">the online documentation</a>
for details.

Rule based notifications are turned off per default. They do not harm you in
any way as long as you do not enable them. If you turn them on then your current
flexible notification settings are <i>not</i> being converted!
