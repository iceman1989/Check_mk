0.078000      --> failed to load C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn\Resources\1031\sqlevn70.rll

rll files are Windows Resource Libraries ( used for localisation )

The loadlibrary call in the check_mk_agent fails when loading the sqlevn70.rll
file, leading to an incorrect localized (not localized at all...) message

There is no documentation in the internet of how to correctly
load *.rll files. It could even be the case the that file should
be loaded by the DLL itself. Since this seems to be hard to
fix and the error message seems to be present at least unlocalized
or incomplete, we close this bug.
