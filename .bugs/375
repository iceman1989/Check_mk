Title: Clusterchecks: make host name available to check

Problem: When using cluster checks, the check itself has no
information, on which node of the cluster a certain check item
has been found. If we would have that information, we could
output something like "OK - running on node zbghora10".

We could extend the API for checks in a way, that the check
can *declare* that it always wants the name of the host as
an additional (first) column in the info table. This can
be done with the new dictionary. Checks that are cluster
aware (ps, df, services) can then use that information and
display the node (maybe on a configurable basis). Maybe
we can use None as host name in case the check is not a cluster
check. That way we omit useless data on non-clustered checks.

Check_MK need then internally to conserve that information
in case of cluster checks. The logic for the non-cluster-checks
must not be changed or be degraded in performance.

==> That way the API for the checks keeps compatible and
we have the "running on" information, which is also usefull
for BI.
