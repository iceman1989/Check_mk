below var/check_mk/web/<user>/, there are several files being created during
working with multisite. For example the file sidebar.mk is being created once
the user starts customizing the sidebar. It should be possible to remove the
customized sidebar to use the default sidebar again.

Same for other files like buttoncounts, treestates, view options, ...
