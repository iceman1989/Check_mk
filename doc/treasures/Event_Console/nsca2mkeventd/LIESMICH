Install into OMD site
=====================
Prerequirements:

  - Have an existing OMD site
  - Have the NSCA running in the site
  - Have the MK Event Console running in the site

Copy the nsca2mkeventd program to the site and make it executable:

cp -p nsca2mkeventd /omd/sites/<site>/local/bin
chmod +x /omd/sites/<site>/local/bin/nsca2mkeventd


Copy the init script and enable the service:

cp -p nsca2mkeventd.init  /omd/sites/<site>/etc/init.d/nsca2mkeventd
ln -s ../init.d/nsca2mkeventd /omd/sites/<site>/etc/rc.d/70-nsca2mkeventd


Change the nsca configuration to forward the events to the nsca2mkeventd pipe.
Open /omd/sites/<site>/etc/nsca/nsca.cfg and change the parameter "command_file"
to /omd/sites/<site>/tmp/run/nsca2mkeventd.pipe


Now restart all services.

omd restart <mysite>


Now all check results incoming from the sites NSCA daemon, are handed over
to the command pipe opened by the nsca2mkeventd and then handed over to
the event console of the site.
