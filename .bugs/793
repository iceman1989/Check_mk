Title: Allow to rename services in a free an flexible way
Component: core
State: open
Date: 2012-10-12 16:11:54
Targetversion: future
Class: feature

Currently services can only partially be renamed. For example you
can change fs_%s to "Filesystem %s". It would be nice to be 
able to rename "LOG /u01/app/oracle/tools/log/rman.log" -> "BCK-ORA rman.log"
It is not clear what impact such a feature has on the core and WATO, on
PNP Templates an the like.
