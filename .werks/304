Title: Escaping several unwanted chars from incoming log messages

There are several kind of chars which are not wanted to be included
in log messages. For example the null byte is nothing to be expected
in log messages. We simply remove those chars now from the log messages.

Single log lines do not contain new line chars (\n), since they are 
already processed as single lines. But snmp traps might contain those
chars, which might break e.g. processing the log history (resulting
in error messages "Invalid line XX in history file..."). The newline
chars are now simply removed from the incoming data.
This might change incoming values, but this seems to be better than 
before. In future, when trap the parsing/processing code is extended
by single value matching etc., we might be able to clean this up.
