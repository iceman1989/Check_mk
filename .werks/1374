Title: arc_raid_status: moved plugin into main Linux agent
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1408805484
Class: feature

The functionality of the agent plugin <tt>arc_raid_status.sh</tt> has
been moved into the normal <tt>check_mk_agent</tt> for Linux. If you
have deployed the plugin, please remove it. Not doing this does not
do great harm but will result in <tt>cli64 rsf info</tt> called twice
per agent execution.

Note: you still have to manually install <tt>cli64</tt> from
<a href="ftp://ftp.areca.com.tw/RaidCards/AP_Drivers/Linux/CLI/">ftp://ftp.areca.com.tw/RaidCards/AP_Drivers/Linux/CLI/</a> into <tt>/usr/local/bin/</tt>
in order to use this check.
