Title: logwatch loses last line id on logrotate
Component: checks
State: open
Date: 2011-10-21 10:07:19
Class: feature

If in the last minute before the log rotate an error
line is logged, that line might be missed by mk_logwatch.

We currently do not plan to address this problem. We
would need to make the logrotate filename pattern
configurable. Much complicated troublesome work...
