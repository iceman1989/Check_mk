Event Console check does not find events anymore when matching is done by hostname
if matching via IP is configured, everything works
root problem seems to be: eventconsole displays hostname in all lower case, uses internally mixed Upper/lower case instead

2013-10-03 11:01:38: changed state open -> done
check_mkevents no always uses case insensitive host name matching.
