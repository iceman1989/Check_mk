In the reporting options of the <i>Availability</i> pages there is
now a new option called <i>Show timeline of each object directly in table</i>. When
this is enabled then for each host or services the timeline chart is being
included directly in the availability table. When hovering over one of the
colored sections a small popup will show the details about that section.

Also new vertical bars indicate hours, days, weeks and months. Just hover
over such a bar in order to see its precise date.
